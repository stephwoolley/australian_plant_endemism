However, with the few trees present in each locality the 2 km grid (IUCN recommended standard) is likely to be too generous. The AOO is by all estimates much less than 500 km², the population is severely fragmented and when this species declines with its congeners, as it is reasonable to assume, it meets the B criterion for listing as Endangered (EN).","Grows in dwarfed montane forest and temperate rain forest, often associated with the other species of <em>Athrotaxis</em>.","Because it occurs usually as solitary individuals, rarely in small groups, and generally with or near one or both of the other species A. cupressoides and<em> A. selaginoides</em>, it is at risk of extinction mainly because of its low number of individuals overall.

In the past, European colonists cleared areas of mangroves for community development. Currently, mangroves are being cleared for urban development, ports, airports, and tourist resorts, but the overall impact on Australian mangroves is low (Spalding <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/><br/>All mangrove ecosystems occur within mean sea level and high tidal elevations, and have distinct species zonations that are controlled by the elevation of the substrate relative to mean sea level. This is because of associated variation in frequency of elevation, salinity and wave action (Duke <em>et al</em>. 1998). With rise in sea-level, the habitat requirements of each species will be disrupted, and species zones will suffer mortality at their present locations and re-establish at higher elevations in areas that were previously landward zones (Ellison 2005). If sea-level rise is a continued trend over this century, then there will be continued mortality and re-establishment of species zones. However, species that are easily dispersed and fast growing/fast producing will cope better than those which are slower growing and slower to reproduce. <br/><br/>In addition, mangrove area is declining globally due to a number of localized threats. The main threat is habitat destruction and removal of mangrove areas. Reasons for removal include cleared for shrimp farms, agriculture, fish ponds, rice production and salt pans, and for the development of urban and industrial areas, road construction, coconut plantations, ports, airports, and tourist resorts.

The species is well represented in the conservation estate, including occurring within a designated Priority 1 Ecological Community. Several sub-populations are considered to be in decline due to changes in hydrology resulting from habitat fragmentation for agricultural and urban development. A population decline between 30 and 50% over the past three generations is inferred from the documented loss of previously recorded subpopulations. Climate change may pose a serious threat to the viability of the species in the future, but the effects of this remain uncertain. In addition there is a significant threat from illegal collection, as well as habitat destruction and degradation. Although it is probable that additional sites occur in remote areas of conservation land within the species' range, this species is iconic and the level of survey undertaken in this region suggests that current estimates of populations numbers and extent are reasonably accurate.

This is one reason why major disturbances (e.g. altered hydrology, habitat loss), can have a catastrophic effect on the viability of entire populations.","The main causes of decline are changes in hydrology resulting from habitat fragmentation for agricultural and urban development. In addition there is a significant threat from illegal collection, as well as habitat destruction and degradation. Preliminary modelling suggests that the species will be threatened by the effects of climate change in the future, perhaps very significantly so, however in the absence of rigorously tested modelling based on replicated climatic simulations the true impact of climate change scenarios on the species future distribution remains unknown.","Throughout its range, populations of this species are generally small (fewer than 100 plants) however some sub-populations are estimated to number several hundred individuals.

Fire is the main threat to the species and the extent of the largest fire in the Gouldburn area was 240 km<sup>2</sup>. Therefore the known localities are considered as one location. Furthermore, the number of mature individuals in the known subpopulations is declining and this species is fire sensitive with fire intervals of less than 10–15 years likely to result in subpopulation declines. It was initially reported within the Wollemi National Park but that is now believed to be a different species, therefore additional survey in this area is required. This species has been listed as Vulnerable under the EPBC Act and its seeds have been banked as an <em>ex situ</em> conservation measure. Under the IUCN Red List Criteria it warrants listing as Critically Endangered. It is recommended that further research is carried out on the response of this species to fire, habitat status, population size and levels of threats.

At Dingo Creek it grows in association with <em>Angophora floribunda</em>, <em>Eucalyptus sideroxylon</em> and <em>E. tereticornis</em>. In creek systems flowing from Mount Dangar e.g. Boodles Creek, the species is in association with <em>Angophora floribunda</em> and <em>Eucalyptus dawsonii</em> and <em>E. punctata</em>. It generally occupies sheltered site, north facing at 0-300 m altitude. This species is pollinated by insects, but self pollination is also likely to play a role in the reproduction of this species. Its seeds are hard coated, which induces a period of dormancy and are mostly locally dispersed. Dispersal and dormancy may be assisted by action of water in riparian zones. The species is likely to be fire sensitive (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service 2000). Plants reach maturity at approximately 3 years following germination, peak maturity may not be reached until 4 – 6 years (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service 2006).","Immediate threats to this species include wildfire, inappropriate hazard reduction burns and associated fire management activities.

It is restricted to small areas of native vegetation along roadside verges and by pastureland. The estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) is 55–180 km<sup>2</sup> and the estimated area of occupancy (AOO) is 56 km<sup>2</sup>, both fall within the thresholds for Endangered under criteria B1+B2. The estimated EOO is calculated from herbarium specimen records but a new survey of all known sites is recommended as it is possible the EOO is less than 100 km<sup>2</sup> and could fall below the threshold for Critically Endangered under criterion B1. The species distribution is severely fragmented with small subpopulations separated by areas of agricultural land.<br/><br/>The quality of this species habitat is inferred to be continuing to decline due to a number of threats, especially competition from weedy species, inappropriate fire regimes, disturbance from road and firebreak maintenance and chemical drift from fertilisers and herbicides. In Western Australia there has been clearance of native vegetation for agriculture which is suspected to have reduced the distribution of this species. However there is not enough evidence to calculate a past population reduction for criterion A. In 2007 the total population was estimated to be around 600 individuals which would qualify this species for Vulnerable under criterion D1. The population trend was reported to be decreasing in 2002, but since then there has been intensive conservation efforts which have increased the population size. However the current population trend is unknown and it is suspected that this species is dependent on continued conservation efforts. In summary this species is assessed as Endangered B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii). It is recommended that <em>in situ</em> and <em>ex situ</em> conservation activities for this species continues.","The Blunt Wattle is a shrub up to 2 m high (Orchard and Wilson 2001). The species has a seed with small aril, which in <em>Acacia</em> species is often linked to dispersal by ants (O'Dowd and Gill 1986). The Blunt Wattle is found growing in gravelly brown sand or loam in heathland (Orchard and Wilson 2001). Herbarium specimens have also been collected from the edge of pasture fields, remnant roadside vegetation, degraded road verges and open shrubland. The Blunt Wattle is found in the Avon Wheatbelt and Geraldton Sandplains ecoregions (Western Australia Herbarium 2016), part of the wider Southwestern Australia Forests and Scrub ecoregion (Olson <em>et al.</em> 2001).","The Blunt Wattle's distribution is within the Southwest Australia biodiversity hotspot where one of the main threats has been clearance of native vegetation for agriculture (Conservation International 2016). The species is mainly found on roadside verges and in small areas of remnant native vegetation on private land next to pastures. This suggests that the species may once have been more widespread with a wider distribution than currently. There are many threats to the small patches of native vegetation where this species is found leading to a reduction in habitat quality. These include disturbance from road and firebreak maintenance, chemical drift from fertilisers and herbicides, competition from weeds and inappropriate fire regimes (Bayliss 2003, DE 2016). <br/><br/>There is no specific information on the Blunt Wattle's response to fire but it is suspected that plants would be killed by fire (Bayliss 2003). However fire has some benefits with seeds in the soil seed bank stimulated to germinate following fire (Yates and Broadhurst 2001). In areas dominated by agriculture, fire frequency is often reduced which can lead to fewer opportunities for regeneration of <em>Acacia</em> species (Yates and Broadhurst 2001). Competition from weeds is a serious threat to all subpopulations of the Blunt Wattle and leads to reduced recruitment of young seedlings (Yates and Broadhurst 2001) and can increase the fuel load leading to an increased risk of more frequent fires (Bayliss 2003). Grazing from native and introduced wildlife is also a potential threat (Bayliss 2003) and during reintroduction experiments there was a small improvement in survival of reintroduced Blunt Wattle seedlings when cages were used to protect them (Monks and Coates 2002). It is unknown if the Blunt Wattle is susceptible to <em>Phytophthora</em> dieback (Patrick and Brown 2001).","In 2002 there were nine known subpopulations of the Blunt Wattle, eight of wild origin and one of reintroduced plants (Bayliss 2003). The eight wild origin subpopulations had 263 individuals recorded in 2002 (Bayliss 2003). For this assessment all population numbers were inferred to be of mature individuals. In 2002 three subpopulations had over 100 individuals present whilst five subpopulations had only 1–10 individuals present (Bayliss 2003). It is unknown if these small subpopulations remain viable in the long term. One subpopulation had one plant recorded in 1998 and no plants seen in 2003 (Bayliss 2003), and is not known if the Blunt Wattle is still present at this subpopulation. Some subpopulations have been revisited in the last 10 years to collect seeds for <em>ex situ</em> conservation, but the number of individuals recorded remains low, with a range of 2–42 plants seen (unpublished data, RBG Kew).<br/><br/>The reintroduced subpopulation, found near Carnamah consists of plants grown from <em>ex situ</em> seed collections and planted at this site from 1998 onwards (Monks and Coates 2002, Bayliss 2003). These reintroductions were reported to be successful with good survival and the plants were reproducing naturally (Monks and Coates 2002). In 2007 a total population of around 600 individuals was reported, with over half the population from reintroduced plants (Cochrane <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>The population trend was reported to be decreasing in 2002 (Buist <em>et al.</em> 2002). Flowering intensity and viable seed production of native subpopulations was reported to vary between years and subpopulations (Yates and Broadhurst 2001, Buist <em>et al. </em>2002). A persistent soil seed bank was observed but as fire related germination cues are needed to break seed dormancy, seed germination may be sporadic (Buist <em>et al.</em> 2002). Seedling establishment is also low due to competition from annual weeds (Buist <em>et al.</em> 2002, Bayliss 2003). With intensive conservation efforts there has been an increase in the total number of individuals recorded from 2002 to 2007. However with the latest population data almost ten years old the current population trend is unknown, it may be increasing but if conservation efforts have reduced it may be decreasing again.<br/><br/>The Blunt Wattle's distribution is reported to be severely fragmented (Bayliss 2003), with subpopulations found in small isolated patches of native vegetation. The dispersal mechanism of this species is unknown but it has a small aril to seed ratio (Orchard and Wilson 2001) which is linked to dispersal by ants (O'Dowd and Gill 1986). Further research is recommended but if it is confirmed that the Blunt Wattle is dispersed by ants this could reduce the potential distance that seeds could be dispersed.",Unknown,"The Blunt Wattle&#160;is endemic to Western Australia and is only found in a small area between Coorow and Carnamah in Moora district. The altitudinal range is unknown. The estimated EOO is 55–180 km<sup>2</sup>, the upper figure includes all herbarium specimens, the lower excludes specimens collected before 1970 which have less detailed locality information.",,Terrestrial,"The Blunt Wattle is not found within any protected areas. A herbarium specimen was collected close to the Capamauro nature reserve but the species has not yet been recorded at this locality. There has been an intensive programme of <em>ex situ</em> seed conservation by the Threatened Flora Seed Centre in Western Australia with multiple seed collections conserved and also duplicated to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in the UK. Seedlings have been grown and plants successfully transplanted into the wild (Bayliss 2003, Cochrane <em>et al.</em> 2007). A research project has studied methods to improve the survival of reintroduced plants of the Blunt Wattle, for example, examining whether using mulch around plants or using cages improved survival in the wild (Monks and Coates 2002). <br/><br/>In Australia this species is currently assessed as Endangered due to the low number of individuals and a decline in the quality of the habitat (DE 2016). The species was previously assessed in Australia as Critically Endangered (Bayliss 2003) and still remains listed as Critically Endangered within Western Australia (DE 2016). An interim recovery plan for the Blunt Wattle was published for 1999–2002 and then renewed for 2003-2008 (Bayliss 2003). A new recovery plan and monitoring of the population is recommended. The species is included in the rare and poorly known flora management guidelines for Moora district, which raises awareness of rare species to local land managers and conservation organisations (Patrick and Brown 2001).",Australasian,,false,false,Global

The estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) is 420 km<sup>2</sup>. The area of occupancy (AOO) is unknown but as this species is mainly found in small areas of remnant native vegetation next to roadsides and agricultural fields the AOO is suspected to be less than 500 km<sup>2</sup>. The EOO and AOO fall within the thresholds for Endangered under criteria B1+2. There are 15 subpopulations. The small areas of remnant vegetation where this species is found are  declining in habitat quality due mainly to threats from road, rail and firebreak maintenance, competition from invasive weeds and salinity. Due to the historic clearance of native vegetation for agriculture in  the Southwest Australia biodiversity hotspot there may have been a  population reduction of this species in the past however there is not enough evidence  currently to use criterion A. <br/><br/>The species could qualify as Endangered under criterion B1b(iii,v)+2b(iii,v) but the number of locations is suspected to be greater than ten. The major threats are not thought to occur at each subpopulation simultaneously as the subpopulations are on land owned and managed by different organisations and private individuals. However the Orange-flowered Wattle does qualify as Vulnerable under criterion C2a(i) as there are 1,200 individuals in total, less than 1,000 individuals per subpopulation and an observed continuing decline in the number of mature individuals due to the decline in habitat quality. There is an active recovery plan for the Orange-flowered Wattle and it is recommended that conservation actions continue. Surveys to establish the current population size are also recommended.","The Orange-flowered Wattle is a shrub 0.3–1 m high (Orchard and Wilson 2001). It is found growing on clay, loamy clay or sandy soils in open shrubland or low <em>Eucalyptus</em> woodlands with <em>Melaleuca </em>and <em>Poaceae</em> species (Orchard and Wilson 2001, DEC 2009).

The species is mainly found on roadside verges and in small areas of remnant native vegetation on private land next to agricultural land. These small areas of remnant vegetation are very vulnerable to damage from road, rail and firebreak maintenance; plants can be damaged by spraying verge vegetation and road grading can disturb the habitat (DEC 2009). Competition from invasive weeds is another serious threat, reducing the health of mature plants and seedlings of the Orange-flowered Wattle (DEC 2009). High numbers of weeds can also lead to an increase in the frequency and intensity of fires (DEC 2009). Other threats to the subpopulations of the Orange-flowered Wattle include salinity, drought, waterlogging of soil, degradation of associated vegetation and grazing from rabbits and livestock (DEC 2009). It is not known if the conservation actions in the species recovery plan have reduced some of these threats. However the most recently known herbarium specimens, collected in 2011 from roadsides, reported degraded understorey vegetation, evidence of soil disturbance and weed coverage from 25–50%.<br/></p>","There were 15 subpopulations with 1,200 mature individuals of the Orange-flowered Wattle reported in the species recovery plan (DEC 2009). Each subpopulation was surveyed between 1999–2003 and the number of individuals at each subpopulation varied from 15 to 411 (DEC 2009). Dead individuals were noted at eight subpopulations, whilst seedlings were observed at seven subpopulations (DEC 2009). The majority of subpopulations were considered to be in a moderate or healthy condition, with one subpopulation considered in a poor condition (DEC 2009). Some subpopulations or parts of subpopulations were surveyed two or three times between 1995–2003, of these four had increased number of mature individuals, two had decreases and four remained reasonable stable (DEC 2009).

It is only found at two sites, Mount Gibson and Ninghan station, both former agricultural stations for domestic sheep. Mount Gibson is now managed solely for conservation and part of the Ninghan station is an Indigenous Protected Area. The estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) is 65 km<sup>2</sup>, the area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated as 30–100 km<sup>2</sup>. The EOO falls within the threshold for Critically Endangered in criterion B1 and the AOO falls within the threshold for Endangered in criterion B2. <br/><br/>There is a continuing decline in habitat quality from a number of threats including grazing from feral goats and domestic sheep, drought and inappropriate fire regimes. The most serious threat is inferred to be grazing from feral goats, which is particularly severe during drought conditions. As the two sites are managed by different landowners it is inferred that the severity of grazing and the effectiveness of feral goat management differs between the sites and it therefore inferred that there are two locations.<br/><br/>With a population size estimated at 661 individuals the Gibson Wattle would qualify for Vulnerable D1. Due to an active recovery plan and ongoing conservation activities the population trend is suspected to be increasing, therefore the Gibson Wattle would not qualify for criterion C. In summary the Gibson Wattle is assessed as Endangered B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii). Ongoing conservation activities are required and the subpopulations should be closely monitored.","The Gibson Wattle is a semi prostrate spreading shrub, 0.3–1 m high to 3 m wide (Orchard and Wilson 2001). It is found flowering from August to September (DEC 2009). It grows on the summit and slopes of hills on rocky red loam soils in open tall shrubland (DEC 2009). The Gibson Wattle is found within the Southwest Australia savanna ecoregion (Olson <em>et al.</em> 2001), on the border of the Avon Wheatbelt and Yalgoo bioregions (Western Australia Herbarium 2016).","The Gibson Wattle is only found at two sites, both former agricultural stations for domestic sheep. Grazing by sheep and later by feral goats has been one of the most serious threats to the Gibson Wattle and other vegetation at these sites (DEC 2009). For example, at one subpopulation in 2001 80% of plants of this species were reported to have died due to grazing (TSSC 2008), which was particularly serious in 2001 due to a drought in the region (DEC 2009). Sheep have largely been removed from the Mount Gibson site and at Ninghan station the numbers of sheep have been reduced from 18,000 in 1993 to around 2,300 in 2004 (DEC 2009). There is also a feral goat management plan in place which has reduced numbers at both sites, for example, around 9,000 goats were removed from the Ninghan station from 1997–2007 (DEC 2009). It is inferred that the goat management programme continued after the publication of the recovery plan. However it is not known how many feral goats and domestic sheep are left currently at each site and grazing is suspected to be an ongoing threat. <br/><br/>Inappropriate fire regimes are a threat to the Gibson Wattle as this species is thought to germinate following fire (DEC 2009). Reduced fire frequency may lead to a decline in recruitment for the species (DEC 2009). Droughts occur in this region and a serious drought from 2001–2004 resulted in the death of many individuals of the Gibson Wattle and an increase in grazing pressure (DEC 2009). Since the 1970's there has been a 15% reduction in rainfall due to climate change in south western Western Australia (Climate Commission 2013) and droughts are suspected to remain an ongoing threat for this species. Other plausible threats include disturbance from track maintenance at both sites and mineral exploration (DEC 2009). Both sites are in areas covered by mining leases, allowing companies to explore for new sites from minerals. There are active mine sites 15-20 km to the west of Mount Gibson but there is no known current mining exploration within the Gibson Wattle's distribution.","There are six (DE 2016) or seven (DEC 2009) subpopulations known of the Gibson Wattle at two localities. One subpopulation needs further research as plants collected at this site showed morphological characteristics of the related <em>Acacia kochii. </em>Five subpopulations have been continually monitored and the number of individuals have been counted since either 1992, 1994 or 2001 (DEC 2009). In 2001 the total population size recorded was 270 plants and in 2004 this had increased to an estimated 550 plants (DE 2016). It is inferred that these figures are all of mature individuals. This change was reported to be due to an increase in the number of individuals at two subpopulations and an increase in survey effort by local botanists (TSSC 2008). Some subpopulations were resurveyed in 2007 and the total population size was estimated at 661 individuals (DEC 2009). <br/><br/>Between 2004 to 2007 all subpopulations were reported to be in a moderate or healthy condition (DEC 2009). Subpopulation size ranges from 25 to 300 plants (DEC 2009).

Although 70% of the population is found in protected areas the species habitat quality is inferred to be under continuing decline due to inappropriate fire regimes and illegal removal of <em>Eucalyptus</em> trees which provide shade for this species. The latest population estimate from 2000–2001 is 306 mature individuals in five subpopulations which would qualify the species for Vulnerable D1. With a population of less than 2,500 individuals and less than 250 individuals in each subpopulation this could also qualify the species as Endangered under criterion C2a(i) however the population size is inferred to be increasing not declining. However, due to its small range, the Dwarf Rock Wattle is assessed as Endangered B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii). This species is also assessed in the Australia EPBC Act as Endangered. Monitoring of the whole population and ongoing species recovery plans are recommended.","This species is a small shrub, 30–50 cm tall (Maslin 1995). Plants flower from November to March and fruiting pods take nearly a year to mature (Maslin 1995). Seeds are mature in October when mature flower buds for the next flowering season are present (Maslin 1995). The species habitat is open mallee with<em> Eucalyptus ebbanoensis </em>and open heath of <em>Allocasuarina </em>and <em>Dryandra</em> species (Holland <em>et al. </em>1997). It is confined to the ridge of lateritic breakaways and often grows in rock crevices (Maslin 1995, Holland <em>et al.</em> 1997). This species is found in the Avon Wheatbelt ecoregion (Western Australia Herbarium 2016), in the Southwestern Australia Forests and Scrub ecoregion (Olson <em>et al.</em> 2001).","The Dwarf Rock Wattle is found in the Southwest Australia biodiversity hotspot   where one of the main threats has been clearance of native vegetation   for agriculture (Conservation International 2016). In the Avon Wheatbelt region 83.5% of native vegetation has been cleared for agriculture (Collins 2009). The Wongan Hills are part of the Shire of Wongan-Ballidu which has been extensively cleared for wheat and sheep farming, although in the Wongan Hills there are still substantial areas of remaining bushland (Holland <em>et al.</em> 1997).<br/><br/>Inappropriate fire regimes are a threat to this species and to the habitat quality. High fire frequency can affect the quality of this species habitat,  deplete soil seed banks, kill juvenile plants and allow invasive weeds  to establish. Low fire frequency can also be damaging as fire may be  needed as a stimulate for germination of native species from the soil  seed banks (Holland <em>et al. </em>1997, Collins 2009). In this species fires are suspected to interfere with reproduction leading to low or zero seedling recruitment but fire is also suspected to stimulate germination from the soil seed bank (Holland <em>et al. </em>1997). <br/><br/>Other threats to the Dwarf Rock Wattle include grazing, loss of shade and tourism. This species is rarely found on grazed sites and is inferred to be vulnerable to grazing by sheep (Stack <em>et al.</em> 2006). The shade of <em>Eucalyptus ebbanoensis </em>is important to protect this species from the worst effects of summer droughts but the illegal removal of <em>Eucalyptus</em> trees for Digeridoo production is a potential threat for up to 80% of the population (Stack <em>et al.</em> 2006). One subpopulation is next to part of the Mount Matilda walking track in the Wongan Hills nature reserve so may be damaged by trampling (Stack <em>et al. </em>2006).

It is a small semi-aquatic annual, found in seasonally inundated depressions and swamp margins on clay plains. This species is assessed as Endangered B2ab(iii) as its area of occupancy (AOO) is unlikely to exceed 100 km²<sup></sup>, there are five locations and a continuing decline observed in the quality of habitat. The Murray River subpopulation was excluded from this assessment as plants have not been seen there for 130 years, and due to a decrease in habitat quality is presumed extinct in this locality. The species could also qualify for Vulnerable under C2a(i) as from available subpopulation estimates it is inferred that each subpopulation has 1,000 or less mature individuals, with less than 10,000 individuals in total. There has been a decline in the number of individuals at the Meereek Flora Reserve subpopulation between 1987 and 2011. However new survey data across the whole population is required to be certain that there is a continuing decline in the number of mature individuals. As this species is listed on several Australian conservation acts as  endangered or threatened there is an active national recovery plan.","This species is a small semi aquatic annual, found in seasonally inundated depressions and swamp margins on clay plains (Sutter 2010), often associated with <em>Eucalyptus, Myriophyllum, Utricularia</em> and Cyperaceae species. It is thought that the species requires a period of inundation to enable germination from the soil seed bank. After flowering and fruiting the water levels drop and the depressions dry out allowing the seeds to enter the soil seed bank for the next year (Sutter 2010). The plants are not known to reproduce vegetatively. It is unknown how long seeds remain in the soil but the species does not appear at some sites every year (Sutter 2010).","Since European settlement in southern Australia there has been widespread clearing of native vegetation and draining of swamps (Benson 1991, Sutter 2010, Bradshaw 2012). The potential habitat for this species would have been greatly reduced and it may have been more widespread and common than current records suggest (Sutter 2010). In the medium to long term this species may be threatened by climate change. It only occurs in seasonally inundated wet habitats and it is likely to need water to allow germination of seeds from the soil seed bank. Since 2000 there has been lower than average levels of rainfall in Victoria (ABOM 2016) and there is predicted to be a continued decrease in rainfall in south eastern Australia which could cause less frequent inundation of these seasonal habitats and reduce habitat availability for this species (Sutter 2010).<br/><br/>The Murray River on the border between Victoria and NSW is affected by grazing livestock, salination and competition from introduced weedy species. This species has only been found once on the Murray river in around 1883 and has not been seen since so it could have been affected by the increased salination (DSE 2009) and is presumed extinct at this locality (Smith and Smith 1990).<br/><br/>Grazing and trampling by sheep and competition from weedy species are likely to threaten the South Australia subpopulation which is found on private land. This subpopulation was found to be in a poor condition in 1987 (DSE 2009,&#160;Sutter 2010). Grazing by livestock was affecting the subpopulation at Little Desert National Park and boundary fences were repaired to protect the habitat (Sutter 2010). It is not known if grazing by rabbits or native animals would also affect this species at this site (DSE 2009). Soil disturbance by recreational vehicles was reported in the Pilliga wetlands and Little Desert National Park which may disrupt soil seed banks (Bell <em>et al. </em>2012). In the latter a road was realigned to limit the disturbance from vehicles but further damage was reported in 2008 (DSE 2009).","There are six subpopulations of the Austral Pipewort calculated from herbarium specimen data and this species national recovery plan (Sutter 2010). The three subpopulations in Victoria and South Australia (at Meereek Flora Reserve, Grampians National Park and Little Desert National Park) in total contain around 2,000 plants (Sutter 2010). At Meereek Flora Reserve there were 1,000 plants reported in 1987 (Sutter 2010) and 700 plants were counted in 2011 (specimen data). Information from herbarium specimens collected at the Grampians National Park indicate that around 100 plants were observed in 2011. Along the Victoria and South Australia border there were 500–700 plants estimated in 1990 in the Little Desert National Park and adjoining private land in Bangham (DSE 2009, Sutter 2010). On the NSW and Victoria border along the Murray river plants were collected in 1883 but no subpopulation numbers were known. As there have been no further records from the Murray river it is presumed extinct at this locality (Smith and Smith 1990). In NSW this species is found in Pilliga National Park  and at Back Creek Travelling Stock reserve. In surveys in 2010-2011 in Pilliga National Park this species was reported as occasional to common but was only found in four out of 31 plots surveyed (Bell <em>et al. </em>2012). The current population trend is unknown but is likely to be decreasing due to several threats from climate change, grazing, soil disturbance and competition from weedy species.",Unknown,"The Austral Pipewort (<em>Eriocaulon australasicum</em>) is endemic to Victoria, South Australia and New  South Wales in Australia. In New South Wales the species had only been recorded once (in 1883) at the Murray River along the border with Victoria but it has not been found there since (Sutter 2010). However there are some recent collections from 2009 and 2011 from two new localities in the state. The area of occupancy (AOO) is calculated as 40 km²<sup></sup> using available herbarium records, and due to the specific habitat requirements for this species the AOO is unlikely to exceed 100 km²<sup></sup>.",,Terrestrial,"The majority of this species population is found within four protected areas; Meereek Flora reserve, Grampians National Park, Little Desert National Park and Pilliga National Park, and at Back Creek Travelling Stock Reserve (government land reserved for use by travelling livestock). There are two <em>ex situ</em> seed collections held at the Victorian Conservation Seedbank and at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.<br/><br/>This species is listed as threatened or endangered on several federal and state lists. Across the whole of Australia it is listed as endangered on the Commonwealth Environment Protections and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. In Victoria it was listed as endangered in 2005 on the Advisory List of Rare or Threatened Vascular Plants in Victoria and as a threatened species in May 2015 in the Victoria Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 (DELWP 2015). In NSW it was listed as endangered, possibly extinct in 1999 on the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act, however this was before the two recent subpopulations were discovered in the state.<br/><br/>As this species has been listed as endangered there was a national recovery plan established in 1999 and an updated plan in 2010 setting out objectives for the recovery of this species (Sutter 2010). Victoria also has an Action Statement for this species (DSE 2009). Objectives in both recovery plans include surveys of all populations, studying the life history of the species, identifying potential habitat, controlling grazing threats, identifying problem weedy species, establishing <em>ex situ</em> seed collections and raising awareness of the species (DSE 2009,&#160;Sutter 2010). Conservation actions to protect the species so far include adding boundary fencing to remove grazing and realigning a track to avoid vehicle disturbance at the Little Desert National Park, surveys of existing sites and <em>ex situ</em> seed conservation (Sutter 2010).",Australasian,,false,false,Global

The species has two viable subpopulations in south west Victoria, with an estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) of less than 100 km<sup>2</sup> and an area of occupancy (AOO) of less than 10 km<sup>2</sup>. The population is considered to be severely fragmented and the quality of habitat is inferred to be declining due to several  threats including grazing from introduced herbivores. Although this  species has been part of an extensive recovery programme the total number of  individuals has declined from 720 in 2,000 to approximately 375–450 presently.<br/><br/>This species is now no longer present at some historic  sites and there are three non viable subpopulations. If these extra  subpopulations become viable or if the reintroduction programme results in new viable wild populations then the EOO is suspected to increase to an estimated 1,500 km<sup>2</sup> and the AOO is also suspected to increase, resulting in this species reaching the threshold in criterion B for an Endangered taxon. <br/><br/>This orchid would also qualify as Endangered C2a(i) as the number of mature individuals is less than 2,500,  with an observed decline and each subpopulation has 250 or less  individuals and as Vulnerable D1 as there are less than 1,000 individuals<sup></sup>. Although there has been a  population reduction there is not enough information on generation  length to use criterion A and no quantitative analysis is available for criterion E. Further monitoring of this species and continued species  recovery work are required to ensure the long term survival of this  species.","This terrestrial spider orchid grows in dense coastal highlands and woodlands on deep well drained sand (Backhouse and Jeanes 1995). It is found in the Naracoorte woodlands and the western edge of the Southeast Australia temperate forests ecoregions (Olson <em>et al.</em> 2001). The species flowers from October to November, with a 35 cm tall flowering spike with one to three flowers per plant (Backhouse and Jeanes 1995). The generation length for this species is not known but plants in the wild have survived for at least 17 years (Todd 2000). Like other spider orchids this species has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi and pollinating male Thynnine wasps (Todd 2000, DEWHA 2009). The pollinating wasp species for this orchid was thought to be <em>Lophocheilus villosus</em> (Pritchard 2007, DEWHA 2009) but <em>Lestricothynnus hastata</em> was observed pollinating this species and is now thought to be the main pollinator (Bower, Brown 2010).","There are a number of threats to this spider orchid outlined in detail in the recovery plan (Todd 2000) and in the case study (DEWHA 2009). The largest subpopulation for this spider orchid is at Point Danger, Portland where an aluminium smelter was opened in 1986. Although some plants were translocated or taken into <em>ex situ</em> conservation, the size of available habitat at this site is now reduced and the effect of emissions from the smelter on this orchid and the vegetation needs further research (DEWHA 2009). Grazing by native and introduced herbivores and competition from introduced weeds and invasive native shrubs is a threat at most sites for this species (Todd 2000, DEWHA 2009). Inappropriate fire regimes can be detrimental to this species and its pollinators and further research is required (Todd 2000, DEWHA 2009). There is no evidence of illegal orchid collection but this remains a risk as there is easy access to the Point Danger site (Todd 2000).<br/><br/>One of the most serious threats for the long term survival of this species is the limited natural pollination which was reported to be low or absent at three sites (DEWHA 2009). As part of the recovery programme hand pollination was undertaken, particularly at Point Danger. However during monitoring at Point Danger a low level of natural pollination was observed in 2009 (Bowers) and at Wilkin Flora and Fauna reserve (D. Pitts pers. comm. 2016). In the long term changes in climate may cause this species to flower earlier which could also affect pollination timings (DEWHA 2009).","Until the 1950's this orchid was locally common around the Portland  area in south west Victoria but underwent an extensive decline and was thought to  be possibly extinct (DEWHA 2009). In 1973 plants were found at Point Danger, Portland and several hundred plants were recorded in the early  1980's (DEWHA 2009). An aluminium smelter was built at Point Danger which opened in  1986 and many plants were removed into <em>ex situ</em> cultivation or  translocated to the Discovery Bay Coastal Park. The number of  individuals at Point Danger continued to decline until there were only six  plants in 1996 (DEWHA 2009). Since then there has been an intensive recovery programme (Todd 2000) which has resulted in an increase in the number of  plants at Point Danger and the discovery of a new sites. <br/><br/>Total numbers of individuals across the whole population has varied from 720 individuals reported in 2009 (DEWHA 2009) to approximately 375-450 individuals at present (inferred from 2008 and 2013 observations at the two subpopulations and suspected present numbers from a local experts (D. Pitts pers. comm. 2016). Although the population trend had been increasing from 1996 to 2009 due  to the conservation activities by local scientists (DEWHA 2009) the  population trend is now inferred to be decreasing. However as the reintroduction  programme continues and new viable wild subpopulations are established  then the population trend may increase again.<br/><br/>At the Point Danger subpopulation, 750 individuals were recorded in 2000 (DEWHA 2009), 175 recorded in 2008 (N. Reiter pers. comm. 2016) and approximately 200 individuals are present currently (D. Pitts pers. comm. 2016). The second subpopulation was discovered in 2003 at the Wilkin Flora and Fauna Reserve; there were 70 individuals recorded in 2008 (DEWHA 2009), up to 200 individuals recorded in 2013 (N. Reiter pers. comm. 2016) and approximately 250 individuals at present (D. Pitts pers. comm. 2016). <br/><br/>At the remaining localities for this species which are excluded as non viable subpopulations there are estimated to be four plants. At Lower Glenelg National Park one plant was observed at one site in 2013 and at a second site one plant has been observed and monitored for the last three years (N. Reiter pers. comm. 2016). At the Discovery Bay Coastal Park two plants were observed in 2013 (N. Reiter pers. comm. 2016).",Decreasing,"Mellblom's Spider Orchid (<em>Caladenia hastata</em>) is endemic to Victoria, Australia. It is restricted to the south west of Victoria, with two subpopulations; Point Danger near Portland and at the Wilkin Flora and Fauna reserve. There are also two localities for this species in the Lower Glenelg National Park but as each only contains one plant they are not considered to be viable subpopulations (N. Reiter pers. comm. 2016). The estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) is less than 100 km<sup>2</sup> and the estimated area of occupancy (AOO) is less than 10 km<sup>2</sup>.<br/><br/>Historic herbarium records from additional sites in Victoria have been excluded from the EOO and AOO calculations as these sites are now pine plantations or farmland so are unsuitable habitat for this species (N. Reiter pers. comm. 2016). A record from Beachport in South Australia from 1955 was also excluded as this subpopulation is now thought to be extinct (Todd 2000).<br/><br/>There are are also a few plants at the Discovery Bay Coastal Park which were translocated in the 1980's from Point Danger which are excluded from this assessment. This translocated subpopulation does not fulfill the criteria set by IUCN for introduced subpopulations (IUCN 2014) as plants have not set seed so can not be considered to have produced viable offspring (N. Reiter pers. comm. 2016). The Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne has an active reintroduction programme for this species but plants were introduced to sites in Victoria only two years ago so can not yet be considered as wild populations (N. Reiter pers. comm. 2016).",,Terrestrial,"Conservation measures for this spider orchid have been in place since the 1970's (DEWHA 2009), with the latest recovery plans (Todd 2000, DCE 2004) outlining conservation actions required for this and other threatened spider orchid species. A Threatened Orchid Recovery Team of local scientists, horticulturalists and land managers oversee threatened orchid conservation actions in Victoria (Todd 2000). Measures undertaken include<em> ex situ </em>and <em>in situ </em>propagation, <em>ex situ </em>seed conservation, reintroductions, hand pollination of flowers to aid seed set, caging plants to protect them from grazing, control of invasive weeds, surveys of historic and new sites and community engagement (Todd 2000, DCE 2004, DEWHA 2009). There has been extensive research to improve propagation of this species and other threatened spider orchids (Wight <em> et al. </em>2009) and to isolate the fungal mycorrhiza (Todd 2000). However further research is still required including extent of natural pollination and the effect of fire (DCE 2004, DEWHA 2009). <br/><br/><em>Ex situ</em> living and seed collections are conserved at Kings Park  Botanic Gardens and Melbourne Royal Botanic Gardens and there is also a seed  collection at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew (DEWHA 2009). The majority of this spider orchid's population is found within protected areas, including Point Danger Coastal Reserve, Discovery Bay Coastal Reserve, Lower Glenelg National Park and Wilkin Flora and Fauna Reserve. Part of the population at Point Danger, Portland is found within private land belonging to Portland Aluminium (Todd 2000). The plants at the Discovery Bay Coastal Reserve were original translocated from the Point Danger, Portland site when the Portland aluminium smelter was built (DEWHA 2009).

With the small EOO and AOO this species could potentially qualify for Critically Endangered under criterion B1a and for Endangered under B1a+B2a but the species does not fulfill any other conditions within this criterion. The population size of this species is unknown but it has been reported  as abundant. It is suspected due to the historic loss of native  vegetation through to land change for agriculture in the Moresby Range that the population size has declined but the current  population trend is unknown and further surveys and monitoring are  required. <br/><br/>Although part of this species range is within protected areas the three locations which are unprotected on private land are vulnerable to future land use change from new housing and infrastructure development. The whole population is threatened by an increasingly dry climate and the risk of more frequent and more intense fires. Therefore due to the restricted AOO of 20 km<sup>2</sup>, occurence at five locations and plausible future threats from changes of land use and increased frequency fire this species is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion D2. The threats could very quickly drive this species to being Critically Endangered.","This is a dioecious rush species with stems 25–50 cm high, flowering from&#160;August to October and fruiting October to November (Meney <em>et al. </em>1996, Meney and Pate 1999). Fire kills adult plants but the species regenerates from seed (Meney <em>et al. </em>1996). Plants are found on dry heaths in deep sand over laterite rocks (Meney  <em>et al. </em>1996) or on skeletal soils on lateriate (B. Briggs pers. comm. 2016), in the southwest Australia savanna ecoregion (Olson <em>et al.</em> 2001).","This species is found in the Southwest Australia biodiversity hotspot,  where one of the main threats has been clearance of native vegetation  for agriculture (Conservation International 2015). In the Moresby Range area less than 10% of the original vegetation remains due to historic clearance for agriculture (WAPC 2009). Patches of native vegetation remain throughout the area including near the Howatharra road where this species can be found (WAPC 2009). Outside of protected areas this species is mainly restricted to sites unsuitable for intensive agriculture due to poor low nutrient soils or unsuitable topography like ridges (B. Briggs pers. comm. 2016). <br/><br/>The Moresby Range has historically been used for farmland but there has been an increase in new housing developments and additional infrastructure including roads and water pipelines (WAPC 2009). A new industrial estate is planned at Oakajee not far from the Oakajee nature reserve (WAPC 2009) which could increase the human population in this area. The three locations for this species along the Nanson-Howatherra road are on private property and in 2010 planning permission was submitted by several land owners in this area to change the use of the land from farming to rural small holdings (GHD 2010). This could potentially allow new housing and associated infrastructure to be built in this area.&#160; <br/><br/>Fires occur  naturally in southwest Western Australia and the flora shows a range of  plant adaptations in response to fire, for example reseeding from the  soil seed bank (Lambers 2014). This species is reported to be killed by  mild fires but new&#160;plants germinate from seed (Meney and Pate 1999). In some species of Restionaceae fires can stimulate  germination of seeds from the soil seed bank (Lambers 2014). For  reseeders like this species too frequent fires can kill adult plants  before they have reached maturity but long intervals between fires can  cause a decline in the viability of the soil seed bank (Lambers 2014).  Therefore appropriate fire management and monitoring of this species  habitat is important. In the future this species is suspected to be vulnerable to climate change. In Western Australia they have been changes to rainfall patterns over the last 40 years leading to drier conditions (Climate Commission 2013) and this species sandy shrubland habitat on shallow soils is suspected to be susceptible to droughts (B.Briggs pers. comm. 2016). With projected drier and hotter conditions there may be changes to fire regimes with larger and more intense fires (Climate Commission 2013).",No detailed population information available but this rush has been described as abundant or locally frequent on herbarium specimens.

This spider orchid is highly&#160;localized&#160;in distribution and only known from five localities. A rating of Vulnerable is given to this species due to the restricted extent of occurrence (EOO) (7,000 km<sup>2</sup>), the fact it is only known from five locations, the lack of protection in parts of the range, the high habitat specificity and the high level of threats to <em>Caladenia</em> spp. in this region which has been highly converted to intensive agriculture.&#160;<em>Caladenia dundasiae&#160;</em>&#160;is reported to be restricted but not threatened in Western Australia (A.

The taxon is found with <em>Caladenia hirta</em> and <em>Pterostylis</em> spp. (Brown <em>et al.&#160;</em>2008). It flowers from July to late August. <em>Caladenia</em> species have a 1:1 relationship with a single species of Thynnine wasp, the males pollinating the flowers while attempting to mate with the labellum (Jones 2006). The taxon survives drought underground as a tuber (Hopper <em>et al.</em> 1997). Summer bush fires are expected to stimulate flowering and further recruitment. It is a tuberous orchid with scape to 35 cm tall and red, or rarely cream to yellow flowers. This spider orchid is recognized by its moderately large flower, lalteral sepals and petals stiffly decurved and red labellum with a pale base (Jones 2006). This species is allied to <em>C. filifera,</em> from which it differs in its broader more stiffly held flowers with generally shorter petals and sepals and its smaller labellum with a cream basal lamina and central calli extending further towards the apex. It is also winter flowering, much earlier than other members of the Western Australian <em>C. filamentosa</em> complex growing nearby except for the cream-coloured and smaller-flowered <em>C. hiemalis</em>. Hybrids have not been recorded, possibly because of this strong seasonal isolation (Hopper and Brown 2001).","Most of the region has been taken over for crop cultivation. Much of the remaining land is privately owned. Introduced and feral animals, as well as environmentally harmful farming practices are significant threats to the native vegetation. Threats to <em>Caladenia</em> species in the region include further habitat degradation, fragmentation and loss of remnants, weed infestation, spread of  <em>Phytophthora cinnamoni</em> and <em>P. cryptogea</em>; raising salinity, grazing, most notably by kangaroos (<em>Macropus fuliginosus</em>) but also rabbit and stock and potentially insects. Digging by small mammals which feed on the tuber, and prescribed burning undertaken when the orchid is most vulnerable (between April to early November) are further threats. Threats to roadside subpopulations include grading, chemical spraying, construction of drainage channels and the mowing of roadside vegetation. The impacts of these threats on the population of this species are unknown. <br/><br/>Poor recruitment threatens other <em>Caladenia</em> spp. of the region with few plants developing seed without artificial assistance. It is suspected that low orchid recruitment rates from seed dispersed in their natural environment may in part be due to the patchy distribution of mycorrhiza. Natural recruitment of terrestrial orchids may only occur in years when a longer growing season results from above average spring rainfall prior to the onset of summer dormancy. Climatic conditions during this time are more conducive to the formation of tubers. The taxon is an attractive spider orchid. The taxon does not appear to be sold commercially.

A species may be declared least concern even if the species is being threatened, the population size or distribution of the wildlife has declined, there is insufficient information about the wildlife to conclude whether the wildlife is common or abundant or likely to survive in the wild"" (Queensland Government 2013). It is difficult to assign an assessment category to this species due to the lack of population data and precise values for the AOO and uncertainty in relation to the degree of threat at each locality and lack of numerical data in relation to declines. However, it is inferred from its reported localized distribution and reliance on coastal forest habitats that the AOO falls within the values for a threatened category. At each locality there may be ongoing threats, even within protected areas, such that ten locations may be inferred. The number of ongoing threats implies a continuing decline in the area, extent and quality of habitat. On these inferences it is assessed as Vulnerable. However, field surveys are needed in historical sites of collection and potentially suitable areas to determine the current AOO and population size and monitoring is needed to detect and enumerate declines.","This orchid is a rhizomatous, deciduous, terrestrial orchid, which grows in shady moist areas, in deep leaf litter, under shrubs in coastal rainforest, or in sheltered places in more open habitats, often associated with little rocky rises and dips. The orchid occurs within the eastern Australian Temperate Forests, from 0 to 350 m asl (Bishop 2000, Jones 2006). Plants are dormant over spring and summer and become completely covered by fallen leaves. New growth in late summer grows up through the litter and white root hairs develop wherever the stems are in contact with decaying leaves. It flowers in October and November. The taxon has non-opening, self-pollinating flowers.","Orchids are highly susceptible to disturbance. Loss of habitat for development, agriculture, livestock, logging, urbanization, roadworks and through tourism, are constant threats, with suitable habitat being cleared and fragmented. The quality of small blocks of remnant vegetation may continue to deteriorate where threats are not controlled. Other significant threats to this species include fire and possible suppression by understorey invasive weeds. Coastal development in New South Wales has greatly intensified over the last 20 years, and nearly the entire coastline is inhabited. Coastal development in southeastern Queensland has continued at a similar pace, with all coastal lowland vegetation affected by rapid urban expansion. Even within protected areas, there are a number of threats to native flora and fauna, including trampling by tourists, altered fire regimes, problems of sewage disposal, and the continued spread of weeds (Hogan and McGinley 2012). This is a highly specialized plant that requires this coastal forest which is under anthropogenic pressure even within protected areas. It is also a species which could be subject to predation by invertebrates such as snails or even mammals such as foraging pigs (M. Clements pers. comm. 2014). Such threats have the potential to reduce populations rapidly.","This orchid is reported to be highly localized, but may be locally common (Jones 2006).

It grows singly or in loose groups, in the rare Byron Bay Dwarf Graminoid Clay Heath community, which is unique to the area. The population is small and declining (Jones 2003), although the extent and timescale of the decline is unknown. The geographical extent of the species has been reduced by loss or modification of habitat. Dash (2003) notes that the heathland originally extended to 63 ha but is now a patchy 5 ha in total. This species may become extinct in New South Wales unless the circumstances and factors threatening its survival or evolutionary development cease to operate. It is listed as an endangered species on Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Threatened Species Conservation Act, in New South Wales but is considered to be Critically Endangered by Jones (2003). A rating of Critically Endangered is given to this species as less than 5 ha of the Byron Bay Dwarf Graminoid Clay Heath remains, this orchid has a very high habitat specificity being adapted to this unique coastal heath community and is only known from this one locality. Ongoing threats remain although conservation measures are in place. Searches in other places with similar habitats have failed to locate any further colonies.","This is a medium-sized, tuberous, terrestrial orchid, that grows singly or in loose groups, in the rare Byron Bay Dwarf Graminoid Clay Heath community, which is unique to the area, from 5 to 20 m asl. This coastal, grassy heath of the north coast of New South Wales consists of low-growing (to 50 cm tall) woody shrubs, grasses and grass-like plants with patches of taller shrubs and occasional larger trees, on gently sloping clay ridges. Fern-leaved Banksia (<em>Banksia oblongifolia</em>), Hairy Bushpea (<em>Pultenaea villosa</em>), Kangaroo Grass (<em>Themeda australis</em>) and Broad Sword Sedge (<em>Lepidosperma laterale</em>) are among the most common of its many plant species, with occasional emergents of <em>Lophostemon suaveolens</em> and <em>Corymbia intermedia</em>. The soil is grey to white sand over clay (Jones 2003, 2006; Department of Environment and Conservation 2009). This orchid flowers in August and September (Jones 2003), the only time of the year this species is identifiable in the field. Species of <em>Diuris</em> are mainly pollinated by small native bees, which are attracted by the bright flower colour. Once flowering is completed, seed is set within six to eight weeks and the adult plants become dormant. Reproduction of <em>Diuris</em> is exclusively by seeds with rare examples of clonal tuberous clumping. No vegetative reproduction has been observed in this species. Fires following seeding favour flowering in the next year (Purvis 2008). This species is a tuberous orchid with scape to 30 cm tall, which is recognised by its coastal habitat; its single leaf, which is not purple at the base; bright lemon yellow flowers with brownish or blackish markings; broad labellum mid-lobe; relatively narrow, oblanceolate lateral sepals and small side lobes. It is similar to <em>Diuris chrysantha</em>, but the latter grows in the ranges and tablelands of southern Queensland and New South Wales well inland from the coast, has darker orange-yellow flowers, narrower labellum lateral lobes, an attenuated basal portion on the labellum mid-lobe, and obovate spatulate lateral sepals (Jones 2003). It is possible that earlier records of <em>D. abbreviata</em> from the Byron Bay area are <em>D. byronensis</em> (Jones 2003, 2006).","The Byron Bay Dwarf Graminoid Clay Heath is a rare and endangered coastal heath community. Only about 5 ha of this community remains, and this occurs in small, disturbed and isolated fragments.

Other fragments are protected within the Cape Byron State Conservation Area (Department of Environment and Conservation 2009 a,b). The species is reported as having been reduced in geographical extent by loss or modification of habitat. The known population is threatened by loss of habitat from residential subdivision. It is reported as being at risk of extinction because the population and area of habitat are very small. Other threats include weed infestation, particularly of garden escapes and Bitou Bush (<em>Chrysanthemoides monilifera</em>), a South African plant, once used to stabilise dunes, which has become an invasive weed in coastal areas; inappropriate fire regimes; damage to habitat by human; pollution by run-off from urban areas, and illegal removal of plants by collectors (Jones 2003, Environment and Heritage 2008, Department of Environement and Conservation 2009). Also grazing by feral goats has reduced the quality of habitat (Dash 2003).",This  orchid is known from a locality in the vicinity of Byron Bay.

Locations should not be publicised, however, since the orchid is at risk from illegal collection, it should be ensured that visitors keep to walking tracks and erosion is controlled. Also Bitou Bush,&#160;<em>Watsonia</em> and other environmental weeds in the orchid's habitat should be controlled (Environment and Heritage 2008). A data recording system for the orchid should be established. Research priorities include studies of fire ecology, population biology (to include identification of limiting factors in the lifecycle) and critical habitat requirements and management.

Although significant conservation work has already been undertaken, this species is still at a very high risk of extinction.","This species is endemic to Macquarie Island. The name derives from Greek dienemos, meaning windswept, after the bleak, exposed habitat of this species (Jones 1993). The species inhabits the lower coastal terraces.","The Tasmanian National Parks Association recognized that rabbits on the island were devastating the vegetation and causing subsequent erosion. Rabbits are considered to be an issue for this species (R. Schahinger pers. comm.). Other threats to the species come from the introduced Weka bird (<em>Gallirallus australis</em>), seal wallows at Bauer Bay, landslips, and a changing climate, that may result in the drying of suitable habitat. The species is currently known from only five subpopulations and has a limited area of extent. Levels of genetic diversity in the population could be low due to limited numbers of individuals recorded at each locality and because vegetative reproduction is most common in this genus. In addition, the small population size may lead to inbreeding problems, possibly in combination with insufficient maintenance of populations of pollinating insects and associated mycorrhizal fungi, which in turn may be linked to other threatening factors such as the impact of rabbits and climate change (DPIPWE 2011).","The species has been recorded from eleven sites on Macquarie Island. Data are available for eight of the eleven sites, plant numbers varying from 100 to 5,000+, and the area that it inhabits from 20 m<sup>2</sup> to 10,000 m<sup>2</sup> (Skotnicki <em>et al.</em> 2009).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Macquarie Island in the southwest Pacific.

It does not appear to benefit from adequate protection, with no viable subpopulation present in any secure reserve, although a Species Recovery Action Plan has been designed and is being implemented for this terrestrial orchid. Land use practices that result in habitat degradation and fragmentation pose an ongoing risk.","This is a tuberous, deciduous orchid which occurs among shrubs in windswept, dense, low heathland, on moderately drained dark grey to black sandy peaty loam, between 10 and 30 m asl (Jones 1998, 2006). It also occurs on rocky outcrops (Potts and Wapstra 2000). Most <em>Prasophyllum</em> species are dormant over summer and autumn and begin growth in early winter. This orchid flowers in October and November and the flowers are slightly fragrant (Jones 1998, 2006; Potts and Wapstra 2000). In <em>Prasophyllum</em> species in general, large quantities of nectar are produced by the labellum on which a wide range of insects feed. Some of these, particularly native bees, wasps and beetles, are effective pollinators (Jones 1998).The taxon is recognized by its short slender habit, brownish to greenish flowers with pink to purple labellum, and papillate lalbellum and callus (Jones 2006). It is most similar to <em>Prasophyllum secutum</em> but can be distinguished from that species by its shorter flowering spike, larger flowers, and a dark purple labellum (Jones 1998, Potts and Wapstra 2000).","Native Tasmanian orchid species have experienced a range of threats since European settlement including habitat clearance, land improvement practices, altered fire regimes, habitat fragmentation and the spread of pest plants and animals. Land clearance, significant soil disturbance, for example, ploughing, and application of fertilizer have the potential to eliminate native terrestrial orchids from a site in a single event (Threatened Species Section 2006). At West Point the habitat seems reasonably stable, as the rocky outcrops, with which colonies are associated, tend to remain free of wildfires without becoming overgrown with shrubs which could exclude smaller plants. Within the Arthur-Pieman heathlands, cattle grazing and trampling poses a potential threat. However, landscape change in Tasmania has resulted in a change in the way these habitats are naturally disturbed. The differences in intensity and regularity of fire appears to have actually reduced orchid diversity and extent. Land use practices that result in habitat degradation and fragmentation pose the greatest risk (Jones <em>et al.</em> 1998). This orchid may have had a more widespread distribution in the heathlands of the northern West Coast, but much of the suitable habitat in the area has been converted to agricultural use. Even if it does occur in remnants of suitable habitat north of Marrawah, ongoing threats include land clearing and pasture development in Woolnorth and adjacent private property along the Harcus River Road to the south. The species flowers in the absence of fire, for example on rocky outcrops, but it is thought to respond positively to fire, especially in dense heathland. Inappropriate fire regimes may, however, pose a long-term threat but only if large areas are not burnt for periods over 20-30 years (Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2009). A major concern for this species is the small number and size of known colonies, and small number of plants involved in each. Such small subpopulations could easily be destroyed by serious drought, or localized events such as soil disturbance by animals or ploughing (Potts and Wapstra 2000, Threatened Species Section 2006).","This orchid occurs in very small, disjunct, patches and occupies only between 31 and 61 m<sup>2</sup> in total. It is known from five localities, each with a single subpopulation apart from Couta Rocks and Rebecca Creek, which may have two (Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2009). Subpopulations are typically very small with one or two colonies each consisting of three to five (rarely eight) plants occupying a compact area of only 5 to 10 m<sup>2</sup>. The total number of mature individuals has been estimated to be between 20 and 32 (Potts and Wapstra 2000). In 2008, one of the subpopulations of eight individuals could not be relocated (Larcombe 2008, Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2009). Extensive searches, within the current range and further south, over a number of years, by a number of people, have not found any other colonies. To the north little potential habitat remains, especially in the Woolnorth area, due to agricultural development and the chance of finding new populations in that area is low. While the species will flower in the absence of fire, flowering is possibly stimulated by summer fires. Failure of populations to emerge or fluctuations in population size may be a response to this disturbance requirement (Larcombe 2008). Surveys of recently burnt heathland could increase the chance of finding additional populations (Potts and Wapstra 2000, Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts  2009).",Decreasing,"This species is a terrestrial orchid, 35 cm tall when in flower, which is endemic to Tasmania. It has a highly localised distribution (Jones 2006), being only known from a narrow 30 km stretch between West Point and Sandy Cape, in the far northwest of Tasmania, within the municipality of Circular Head (Jones 1998, 2006; Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2009).

It is listed as Endangered in the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 and Critically Endangered in the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and it is considered to be a high priority species in Tasmania (Threatened Species Section 2006). The fact that one subpopulation of the taxon could not be relocated during extensive field survey could be of concern or may represent either survey timing, or failure to emerge in that season (which was particularly dry) (Larcombe 2008). A short period of flowering and failure to emerge in some years pose a problem for surveying and long-term monitoring. Locating all existing subpopulations of this orchid is important and more field surveys are needed in the hope of finding new subpopulations. Efforts should be made to engage with landowners to formulate management plans, to protect subpopulations against possible changes in land use. Research is needed to determine the optimum fire frequency. Heathlands need to be prevented from becoming too dense but intensity, duration and timing of fire may be significant. Research is also needed to give a better understanding of the factors affecting the population dynamics. These aims are part of the recovery plan which has been devised for this terrestrial orchid (Threatened Species Section 2006, Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2009).

It is native to Tasmania and Victoria in Australia. The species is used for timber. The species is threatened by fire, habitat loss, poor regeneration and Myrtle Wilt infection. All of these have caused major historical population decline and as all threats, except logging, are causing ongoing population decline and are predicted to continue into the future. In Victoria the species is more severely affected by these threats than in Tasmania. The species is also predicted to experience greater decline as a result of climate change and its adverse impact on regeneration. Overall population is predicted to decline by between 30–50% over three generations (past and future). The species is globally assessed as Vulnerable.","<em>Nothofagus cunninghamii</em>&#160;may be a tall tree to 40 m in height (Veblen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1996), but in exposed subapline sites even aged plants may remain as compact shrubs under 1 m in height. The species is dominant in cool-temperate rain forest and in sheltered creeks and gullies. In Tasmania the species can also be found on infertile soils, however it is less dominant in these zones (Veblen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1996). In addition, within Tasmania the species is more likely to be found in mixed stands than in Victoria. Some <em>N. cunninghamii </em>individuals are over 500 years old. In suitable conditions, the species is fast growing, but it generally prefers shaded areas (DPIPWE 2017). The tree usually flowers between November and January and pollen is wind-dispersed (DPIPWE 2017). The species has poor fruit dispersal and seeds can normally only travel up to 150 m from the mother tree (Veblen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1996). Seedling health is generally good, survival rate may be slightly lower in Victoria then Tasmania. The species habitat is subject to decline in area, extent and quality due to fire, drought and clearance for agriculture and silviculture.","The greatest historical threat to the species is from the logging of 'mixed forest' on Tasmania. In sites of logging the regeneration of&#160;<em>Nothofagus&#160;</em><em>cunninghamii </em>is poor and the regeneration of the species will not be favoured, leading to quick decline.<br/><em>&#160;</em><em><em><br/></em>Nothofagus cunninghamii </em>experiences severe loss from fire which is the greatest threat to <em>Nothofagus </em>forests in south east Australia and causes large scale declines particularly within Victoria. Rain forests in Tasmania have decreased by 8% from 1950-1996 due to fire. Fire reduces seedling recruitment in both Victoria and Tasmania, reducing species regeneration. Tasmanian subpopulation may be more adversely impacted by this in the future due to their dependence on seed germination for regeneration. The threat of fire is increased by anthropogenic fire regimes and also global climate change.<br/><em><br/></em><em>Nothofagus cunninghamii&#160;</em>is also susceptible to fatal infection by Myrtle Wilt&#160;(<em>Chalara australis</em>) (spread of the disease may be assisted through the actions of the Pin Hole Borer (<em>Platypus subgranosus</em>) (Veblen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1996, DSE 2005). The risk is greatest to mature trees and is the major cause of gaps in forest cover in Tasmania (Ridley <em>et al. </em>2000). Victorian subpopulations are considered more susceptible to infection that Tasmanian subpopulations, the cause of this is not yet fully understood. The risk of infection increases with disturbance of canopy cover which can occur as a result of human activity such as logging and road construction (Veblen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1996, Ridley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2000). <br/><br/>Trees are no longer commercially harvested in Victoria and yields are considered sustainable in Tasmania, but the species may be harvested on private property but this is not a major threat. Global climate change, specifically climate drying within the region, is predicted to cause future population decline as these processes reduce recruitment potential. The species is further threatened by clearance of cool temperate rain forest for silviculture and agriculture (D. Cameron pers. comm. 2017).","The species is dominant in cool temperate rainforest across Tasmania&#160;(Veblen <em>et al.</em><em>&#160;</em>1996). Within Victoria the subpopulation has been fragmented by a combination of severe natural and anthropogenic events and stands are smaller here. This subpopulation has been subject to historic decline from habitat loss, Myrtle Wilt and fire. Within Victoria, the subpopulation is estimated have declined by 50% over a three generation period (D. Cameron pers. comm. 2017). The subpopulation here is still in decline due to the impact of fire and climate change. These threats also affect individuals in Tasmania and although we do not have decline information available for the Tasmanian population, it is likely to be similar value to that occurring in Victoria.<br/><br/>Globally, it is estimated that <em>Nothofagus cunninghamii </em>will be subject to population decline of between 30 and 50% over three generations (1817-2117) due to a variety of factors.",Decreasing,"The species is endemic to Australia. It is found in Victoria and on the island of Tasmania (WCSP 2017). The estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) is 177,240 km<sup>2</sup>.

The species flowers from November-December (Lowrie 2014).","It is not clear how <em>D. gibsonii</em> responds to fire, however fires during winter and early spring when plants are producing gemmae may threaten population viability through high plant and gemmae mortality. Seed production rates in <em>D. gibsonii</em> appear to be low (similar to many pygmy<em> Drosera</em>), and thus populations may possess a limited capacity to recover from a soil seed bank following intense fires resulting in high levels of mortality (Lowrie 2014).

Future research must elucidate the role of fire in the ecology of this species. A large and extreme bushfire in the summer of 2019/2020 impacted upon the entirety of one population of this species, and given the slow recovery following fire in 1994 it seems likely that this species will recover equally slowly, placing it at significant risk from future fires occurring at high frequency (i.e., prescribed burns).","Only two small subpopulations are known, including one at the base of Bluff Knoll and one in a valley approximately 13 km to the east.

This species has an area of occupancy (AOO) of 244 km<sup>2</sup>, a severely fragmented population, and is facing continuing declines in habitat, number of subpopulations and its population size. It is therefore assessed as Endangered.</p>","<p>This species is a perennial, free-floating, rootless aquatic herbaceous plant, with a simple or sparsely branched stem possessing successive whorls of bristled, prey-catching leaves. The leaves are arranged in whorls of 4–9, measuring up to 23 mm in diameter, and are basally fused with a swollen, dorsally flattened petiole that broadens upwards before dividing into 3–8 terminal, filiform bristles of 4–8 mm length. Stem length is dependent upon water quality, prey abundance and irradiance, but is commonly between 6–20 cm. The compact, whorled structure of the species provides the plant with an almost cylindrical appearance, and gives rise to the species’ common name of the “Waterwheel Plant”.</p>  <p>The growth season for this species extends from early–mid spring into early autumn, with flowers produced throughout summer under favourable conditions. As day length decreases and water temperature begins to drop in mid–late autumn, apical growth becomes increasingly compact and temperate (and some tropical) populations produce dormant overwintering buds called turions (Adamec 2018). Any remaining stem and vegetative material senesces and breaks away from the mature turion, which slowly sinks to the bottom of the water where temperatures are stable and warmer during winter. Overwintering often leads to considerable population losses, with survival frequently only 20–30 per cent (Adamec 1999, Adamec and Lev 1999), particularly as turions failing to sink are generally washed ashore, grazed on by waterfowl, or killed by the onset of frost. In spring, when water temperatures begin to rise once again, the surviving turions float to the surface and recommence growth. In latitudes experiencing very mild winters, it may grow year-round with no overwintering period. Flowering in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. vesiculosa</span> is rare and poorly successful, highly variable between season and populations, and yields exceedingly low numbers of viable seed even under optimum conditions (Cross 2012). While plants from warmer climates are known to bloom with greater profusion and regularity, particularly throughout tropical and sub-tropical Australia, these flowers open only for brief periods and also often fail to develop fruit. Under even the most optimal of conditions plants produce scant numbers of viable seeds, and these are thought to originate almost entirely from self-pollination. The primary dispersive agent in it is likely to be vegetative propagules such as stem fragments or turions, transported externally by birds between suitable habitat.</p>  <p>This species occurs in a wide variety of habitats, from small fens, peat-bog pools and billabongs to lakes, lagoons and river deltas. While it has been infrequently observed in mesotrophic lakes and eutrophic habitats such as fishponds and rice paddies (Breckpot 1997, Adamec 1999a), it is native to nutrient impoverished oligo-mesotrophic and dystrophic (humic) systems (Adamec 1995b, 2018). The stenotopic nature and reliance upon carnivory of this species yield little competitive ability, and limits the species’ distribution to specific microhabitats dominated by loose and species-poor plant communities (Adamec 1995a, 1999a, 2005, 2018; Degreef 1986; Kaminski 1987a). These are generally shallow backwaters or the littoral zone of larger lakes, where competition with other aquatic species forming dense stands is reduced or absent (Kaminski <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1996; Kaminski 1987a,b; Studnicka 1984), and are typically areas experiencing little variation in water level throughout the growing season.

The species is highly clonal, known to propagate strictly by vegetative means throughout most of its range, and is capable of extremely rapid growth under optimal conditions. It inhabits a restricted ecological niche, with very specific habitat requirements and facing further reductions to the abundance of suitable habitat. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. vesiculosa</span> exhibits strongly repressed sexual function dominated by obligate autogamy, and further limits the chance of recombination with the presence of a non-successful floral morph under suboptimal conditions. It is likely to disperse vegetatively over both short and long distances, and persists through unsuitable periods of winter primarily in the form of dormant or non-dormant winter buds rather than seed. The species is contemporary in geological origin, unlikely to have persisted in any given location for long enough to experience significant genetic drift, and has experienced numerous severe bottlenecks in its recent evolutionary history.</p>  <em></em><p></p>","<p>According to a review of conservation threats to carnivorous plants presented by Jennings and Rohr (2011) and revised by Clarke <em>et al.</em> (2018), this species is threatened primarily by residential and commercial development, agriculture and aquaculture, natural systems modifications and pollution. The Commission of the European Union (2009) also lists acidification, canalization, desilting, drainage, eutrophication, forestry clearance, gravel extraction, mining, pollution, hydrological modification and limited dispersal as threats to the species throughout Europe. Eutrophication and water level decline due to warming climate and drought are the main recent threats to the most European sites (Adamec 2018).

The species occupies a very specific and restricted ecological niche within suitable habitats, and declines rapidly following even small changes to habitat quality. It possesses a low dispersive ability and experiences large population fluctuations annually throughout its range. In general, populations number in the hundreds of plants or fewer and may experience up to 70-80% losses due to poor overwintering success throughout Europe (Adamec 1999a).

The degree of protection afforded by these areas varies from unfenced game and nature reserves to carefully monitored and well-maintained national parklands and biosphere reserves, however all provide a degree of crucial habitat security. Managed and protected lands known to harbour extant <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. vesiculosa</span> populations include the Srebarna Managed Nature Reserve and the recently Ramsar listed Dragoman Marsh Complex (Bulgaria), the Zasavica Special Nature Reserve (Serbia), although it is extinct here, the Astrakhan Reserve (Kazakhstan), and the New England Tablelands Endangered Ecological Community (Australia). The effectiveness of conserving only small areas such as these is however limited by landscape-scale changes to hydrology and the intrinsic biotic linkages characteristic of wetland habitats, exemplified by the recent extinction of populations in the Obedska bara Special Nature Reserve (Serbia). One conservation area, formed by two large adjacent reserves, harbours over 50% of the entire global distribution of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. vesiculosa</span> and clearly supports both the need for transboundary conservation and the management of larger scale ecological processes. Encompassing much of the expansive Pripyat River basin, the 48,977 hectare Shatskyi Biosphere Reserve in northwest Ukraine was designated in 2002 and provides some of the most ecologically intact freshwater habitat remaining in Europe, including the Ramsar listed Shatsk Lakes. Seventeen extant <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. vesiculosa</span> populations are known from the reserve, which is carefully monitored for a number of biotic and abiotic factors under the authority of the Scientific-Technical Council of the Shatskyi National Nature Park. Bordering Shatskyi to the west is the West Polesie Biosphere Reserve in East Poland, a similarly protected 139,917 hectare area maintained by the Forum of the International Biosphere Reserve ""Polesie Zachodnie"". Though patches of the Polish reserve are designated for extensive economic use, the lowland area is characterised by a mosaic of swamps, moors, lakes and rivers and eight populations persist in the region. It must be noted however that despite the protections afforded to even large landscapes such as these, widespread habitat degradation is not entirely avoided: historically the two regions harboured between them at least 74 populations which have been gradually lost due to agricultural development and continued wetland eutrophication.</p>",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It has an estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) of 58,000 km². It grows to a large tree of 40 m and is typically a component of cool temperate rain forests between 600 and 1,500 m asl. Stands are usually small and often restricted to watercourses. Climate change is likely to be one of the largest threats to this species due to its occurrence in cool temperate rain forest, predicted to be affected by global warming. It has been noted, that southeast Australia is responding to climate change by becoming warmer and drier, which puts pressure on this rain forest species. In addition, fires are becoming more prevalent with a drier, warmer climate which is likely to be the cause for its fractured locality.&#160;Fires are likely a contributing factor to its historic patchy occurrence and these are likely to contribute to further range contraction with time. The species was historically coppiced and used for timber, but this is no longer a major use or threat to the species. Clonal regeneration has been reported to be common, while sexual regeneration is believed to be rare. This may impede the genetic diversity of the species. It is known to occur in national parks as well as reserves, with a total of 22 <em>ex situ </em>sites cultivating this species. Overall, the species is probably in slow decline, now, mostly due to climate change and fires, while human practices are exacerbating this.&#160;Historically, it is undoubted that the species has been dramatically reduced in extent and abundance through forestry and clearing for agriculture. This is estimated to have caused at least a 30% reduction over three generations.&#160;The species is globally assessed as Vulnerable.","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">On fertile soils in mild climates, the species&#160;typically grows up to <em>c.</em> 40 m tall and has large trunks to 2 m in diameter.&#160;Like many other members of the genus, the species&#160;is monoecious, wind pollinated and exhibits mast flowering. <span lang=""EN-US"">This occurs in spring from August to October while fruits are released from December to March.

The species occurs in several small subpopulations, which may be becoming genetically extinct (R. Hill pers. comm 2018). Currently there is concern that the global population is in decline due to the threat of climate change and increased risk of fire.

The estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) is 196 km<sup>2 </sup>and the estimated minimum area of occupancy (AOO) is 48 km<sup>2</sup>. The current population size is estimated at 2,500 – 3,500 mature individuals, with a small proportion of this estimate being recent reintroductions. Surveys at both national parks have  discovered new localities for the species, increasing the known  population size since the publication of the species recovery plan in 2010 (Sutter 2010). However, there has been an observed decline in the number of mature individuals at both locations, mainly due to flooding events and grazing from introduced herbivores. The quality of habitat is inferred to be declining due to flooding events at Woogmargama National Park and from drought and grazing from introduced herbivores, particularly Sambar deer in Victoria. Therefore the Phantom Wattle is assessed as Endangered B1ab(iii,v)+2ab(iii,v). The species has an active national recovery plan (Sutter 2010) and both national parks are well managed but ongoing recovery actions and monitoring are required.","The Phantom Wattle is a shrub, 1–4 m high and is found flowering in November and December (Walsh and Entwisle 1996). In New South Wales it grows in damp soils along creeks in woodland, whilst in Victoria it is found in higher altitude woodland in cracks between rocks with sparse soils (Sutter 2010). It is found in the Southeast Australia temperate forests ecoregion (Olson <em>et al.</em> 2001).","The Victoria subpopulations of the Phantom Wattle at Burrowa Pine Mountain National Park has decreased in size since 1988 and although the exact reasons for the decline are unknown extended droughts and grazing from introduced Sambar Deer are possible reasons (Sutter 2010, G. Johnson pers. comm. 2016). Grazing from introduced Sambar Deer has significantly increased in Burrowa Pine Mountain National Park in the last three years (G. Johnson pers. comm. 2016) and is the greatest threat to the Phantom Wattle, particularly to reintroduced plants (K. Goyne pers. comm. 2016). Grazing damages young and mature plants, antler rub causes ring barking death of mature plants and large deer can cause physical breaking of the main stems of plants (G. Johnson pers. comm. 2016). <br/><br/>As the Phantom Wattle prefers damp habitats future climate change leading to an increase in periodic droughts may affect this species across it's range (Sutter 2010). The effects of fire on the Phantom Wattle are unknown but as plants can resprout from the rootstock following oeriodic droughts, the species may have some capacity to recover after fire (Sutter 2010). It is suspected that the Phantom Wattle requires some fire as part of its natural life cycle but areas of the Burrowa–Pine Mountain National Park have had no fire since large bushfires in 1952 (K. Goyne pers. comm. 2016). <br/><br/>In New South Wales part of the subpopulation is found on private land  next to Woogmargama National Park and is threatened by competition from  annual grasses (Sutter 2010). Close to Woogmargama National Park are many agricultural farms and if flooding damages fences there is a potential threat of livestock entering the park and damaging vegetation (OEH 2014). There was a severe flood at the park in 2012 which reduced the size of this subpopulation (OEH 2014) and future flooding is a threat to the Phantom Wattle's riverside habitat.","There are two subpopulations of the Phantom Wattle, one at Woomargama National Park in New South Wales with an estimated 2,000 – 3,000 individuals (G. Robertson pers. comm. 2016) and one around and within Burrowa-Pine Mountain National Park in Victoria with an estimated 500 individuals (K. Goyne pers. comm. 2016). The total population size in 2016 is therefore estimated as 2,500 – 3,500 individuals. It is inferred that these are all mature individuals. In 2010 the species recovery plan reported a total population size of 405 plants (Sutter 2010). The increase in population size is mainly due to new surveys in 2013–2015 across the Woomargama National Park which found many new localities for the Phantom Wattle and the discovery of new localities within the Burrow–Pine Mountain National Park (G. Robertson and K. Goyne pers. comm. 2016).<br/><br/>In the species recovery plan from 2010 there were five subpopulations recorded, one in New South Wales consisting of 320 plants and four in Victoria with 85 plants in total (Sutter 2010). In Victoria one subpopulation contains 65 plants and the remaining three contain between five and 10 plants each (Sutter 2010). There had been an observed decline in the number of individuals at the four Victoria subpopulations, with 175 plants recorded in 1988 (Sutter 2010). However current estimates of 500 individuals in Victoria are higher than the 2010 estimates. Plants have been reintroduced into sites within and close to Burrowa-Pine Mountain National Park but survival rates for 2012 ranged from 30–80% in the first year (G. Johnson pers. comm. 2016). At another site within the park 40 plants were planted out in 2014 but by 2016 there were few left due to grazing pressure from Sambar deer (K. Goyne pers. comm. 2016). <br/><br/>In 2012 a severe flood occurred at the only known (at the time) New South Wales subpopulation and the number of plants decreased from 320 to around 50 individuals (OEH 2014). Surveys in 2013–2014 showed this subpopulation remained stable (OEH 2014b). Recently there has been propagation and augmentation in the areas damaged by the flooding with around 400 plants reintroduced (G. Robertson pers. comm. 2016). <br/><br/>The current population trend is unknown. Although parts of the population have experience documented declines in number of individuals, monitoring of the newly discovered localities at both subpopulations are required before an overall population trend can be determined.",Unknown,"The Phantom Wattle (<em>Acacia phasmoides</em>) is found in two national parks, 30 km apart in New South Wales and Victoria.

The estimated area of occupancy is 24 km<sup>2</sup>, while the&#160;extent of occurrence is 11.2 km<sup>2</sup> as measured using a minimum convex polygon; here increased to 24 km<sup>2</sup> to match the AOO (as following the Red List Guidelines for situations where minimum convex polygon EOO is less than AOO). There is an observed decline in the area, extent and quality of habitat and evidence of extreme population fluctuations in response to variable fire management (Cross <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2018). Alterations to the hydrology of critical habitat pose a significant threat to the viability of the species, and population declines have been observed following aseasonal prescribed burns and following long periods of fire suppression.","This species is restricted to seasonally wet, low lying areas of swamp heath in the Canning River basin and Jarrah forest&#160;(Lowrie 2014).","This species is significantly threatened by altered hydrology, habitat loss and fragmentation&#160;due to urban development. Alterations to hydrology are the most significant threat, as the species relies upon seasonally wet areas where soil moisture persists into the summer period (Cross <em>et al</em>. 2013, Lowrie 2014). The Kenwick subpopulation and Clare subpopulation have been significantly impacted upon by increased drying of the habitat in recent years (H. Lambers pers. comm.), and the Kenwick area is unlikely to remain suitable for the species for much longer. This is compounded by ongoing development around the reserve in which the species occurs, which is expected to further impact upon hydrology and potentially also increase the occurrence of invasive weeds. Inappropriate fire management significantly affects recruitment capacity (aseasonal prescribed burns during the flowering period, as occurred in the Brookton Highway population in 2016 resulting in the loss of several hundred flowering individuals). However, the species is a fire responder and significant population recovery occurs after fire from the seed bank. Although the seed bank is thought to be long lived, it is not known how long periods without fire affect population viability (Lowrie 2014, Cross <em>et al</em>. 2013).","<p><em>Byblis gigantea</em> is restricted to a small area east of Perth on the Swan coastal plain in the south west of Western Australia, occuring in a small reserve near Kenwick, and in an area of the Jarrahdale State Forest along Brookton Highway through to the Youraling State Forest (Cross <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Lowrie, 2014; AVH, 2017).

It occurs in scrubby heath often beside creeks, with <em>Corymbia calophylla</em>, <em>Dryandra squarrosa</em> subsp. <em>argillacea</em>, <em>Calothamnus</em> aff. <em>quadrifidus</em>, <em>Viminea juncea</em> and <em>Pericalymma ellipticum</em>.<br/><br/>The Ironstone Grevillea is confined to an area of seasonally wet flat, red brown loam sand over ironstone habitat, of which 90% has been cleared (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1998, Olde and Marriott 1995, Phillimore <em>et al</em>. 1999). This habitat was probably originally highly restricted and has been depleted by land clearing (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2001).<br/><br/>Very little is known about the biology of the species. Many small beetles have been seen on the flowers and the species is believed to be insect-pollinated. Longevity of the seed and the plant’s life span is unknown. Ironstone grevillea regenerates from seed after fire (Olde and Marriott 1995).<br/><br/>Ironstone Grevillea has proved positive to infection from&#160;<em>Phytophthora cinnamoni&#160;</em>(dieback) in the field, but is not susceptible under laboratory conditions.&#160;The species therefore may be able to resist the disease when healthy but succumbs when under stress in the field. Further testing of cinnamon fungus susceptibility is required (Stack and English 2003).","In the past, land clearing may have been a threat to this species throughout its range, although this may not be so for the current locations. The main threats to the Ironstone Grevillea are weed competition, fire, road, rail and firebreak maintenance activities, disease, pine plantation activities, mining, grazing and chemical drift (Stack and English 2003).<br/><br/>Weeds are a serious threat to Populations 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Populations 3 and 4 are very narrow linear populations immediately adjacent to cleared paddocks, and have been shown to be heavily infested with both grasses and broadleaved weeds. Population 2 is a broader linear population, invaded mostly by bulbil watsonia (<em>Watsonia meriana</em> var. <em>bulbillifera</em>), with fewer grasses. Weeds suppress early plant growth by competing for soil moisture, nutrients and light. They also exacerbate grazing pressure and increase the fire hazard due to the&#160;easy ignition of high fuel loads, which are produced annually by many grass weed species.<br/><br/>Grazing by rabbit has impacted on many Ironstone Grevillea populations. In addition to grazing, rabbits also impact on populations by encouraging invasion of weeds through soil digging, addition of nutrients to soil, and introduction of weed seeds. The high level of palatable weeds near these populations attract herbivorous animals, which are often unselective in their grazing.<br/><br/>Road, rail and firebreak maintenance activities threaten plants and habitat at all road verge and rail reserve subpopulations of the Ironstone Grevillea. These include actions such as grading the road verge, constructing drainage channels and mowing the roadside vegetation to improve visibility. These disturbance events also often encourage weed invasion (DEC 2007).<br/><br/>Plantation activities impact on subpopulation 6b and 6c. Activities that may threaten this subpopulation include fertiliser application, firebreak maintenance, tree harvesting and site preparation. In addition, competition for light, soil moisture and growing space will increase as the pine plantation matures (DEC 2007).&#160;<br/><br/>Fire could adversely affect the viability of all subpopulations, as seeds of the Ironstone Grevillea probably germinate following fire. If this is the case, the soil seed bank would rapidly be depleted if fires recurred before regenerating or juvenile plants reached maturity and replenished the soil seed bank. However, it is likely that occasional fires are needed for reproduction of this species (DEC 2007).<br/><br/>Habitat loss and degradation caused by mining is not currently a direct threat to subpopulations of the Ironstone Grevillea. However, minerals sands exploration and activity continues to occur in the region and may pose risk to subpopulations in the future. Subpopulations 1c and 1d occur on private property owned by a mining company, however, the subpopulations are currently managed for conservation (DEC 2007).<br/><br/>Chemical drift from herbicide and fertiliser applications from nearby farmland may affect the species' growth and survival (Stack and English 2003).","The total population size for this species is estimated to be approximately 1,257 mature plants. This is an estimated count from the most recent population monitoring. The species is known from eight locations, some of which have been split into subpopulations. Subpopulation distinctions are based upon differences in land tenure and management, as well as location. The population trend for the entire species appears to be stable.&#160;<br/><br/>The species is a disturbance specialist, so it is likely that plants appear after a disturbance event and then wane in response to competition for nutrients and other resources. No cross-breeding has been recorded for this species (DEC 2007).",Stable,"This species is endemic to Australia, where it is apparently confined to the Whicher Range area, southeast of Busselton in Western Australia.",There does not appear to be any trade in this species.,Terrestrial,"The species occurs in Negus Nature Reserve and Abba State Forest.<br/><em><br/>Petrophile latericola</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Grevillea maccutcheonii</em>&#160;(listed as Endangered under the EPBC Act and Critically Endangered under the Wildlife Conservation Act 1950) also occur in the wider habitat of some populations of the Ironstone Grevillea (Stack and English 2003).

Its range is not within protected areas and it is susceptible to die-back to disease that when introduced to the area will be expected to have a devastating impact on the species.&#160;Grazing by rabbits and decline in the quality of its habitat are additional threats.","The Spreading Grevillea occurs on an undulating plain of gravelly loam that supports very disturbed open low <em>Eucalyptus loxophleba</em> and <em>E. wandoo</em> woodland over species including <em>Dianella revoluta</em>, <em>Kennedia prostrata</em> and <em>Jacksonia</em> sp. (Stack and English 2003).<br/><br/>The Spreading Grevillea has a lignotuber and regenerates after fire. The occurrence of juvenile plants within the Shire road reserve population in July 1998 after fire in 1995 suggests that seed germination may also be stimulated by fire (Stack and English 2003).<br/><br/>While the pollinators of the Spreading Grevillea are unknown, a number of insects have been noted on the flowers, including meat ants, black bull ants, and honeybees (Stack and English 2003). The Spreading Grevillea is probably pollinated by birds (Olde and Marriott 1995), but no birds were seen during field research into biology and ecology of this species (A. Harris pers. comm.). The Spreading Grevillea appears to set seed prolifically in its only known location (Olde and Marriott 1995), however this was not supported by research undertaken in 2002, and the difference may be due to variations in climate as 2002 was a very dry year. Alternatively, the difference in observations may be due to the length of time since fire occurred as fire can stimulate flowering and fruit-set of other species of plants that resprout from a lignotuber, with reproductive effort declining with time since fire (Stack and English 2003). Attempts to propagate this species led to the observations that germination could be improved by nicking the seed coat before sowing, and that it grows readily from firm, young-growth cuttings taken during most seasons (Olde and Marriott 1995).","The main threats to the Spreading Grevillea are weed competition, grazing, road widening and maintenance activities, lack of associated habitat, firebreak maintenance and fire frequency<br/><br/>Competition from introduced grasses and clovers is a threat to the Spreading Grevillea. Many weeds occur in the population’s habitat on the Shire road reserve. Although adult plants appear to be able to compete successfully, weeds may smother the Spreading Grevillea seedlings. They also exacerbate the threat of fire by increasing the fuel load.<br/><br/>Grazing by rabbits is impacting the population. Although the adult plants appear able to cope with grazing, the effect on recruitment of seedlings is likely to be significant. In addition to grazing, rabbits also impact on populations by encouraging invasion of weeds by digging, addition of nutrients to soil and introduction of weed seeds in their droppings. There is widespread subsoil collapse evident in the Shire road reserve, which is possibly related to rabbit burrows. However, this disturbance may actually aid germination and may be a minor issue.<br/><br/>Grading, chemical spraying and construction of drainage channels pose a significant threat to Spreading Grevillea plants occurring on the Shire road reserve, as many plants occur near the roads edge. Mowing of road reserve vegetation could also affect the habitat of this species. These disturbance events can stimulate seed germination, but also often encourage weed invasion. Any bitumen upgrade of the road would have a massive impact, and may only be avoided by realignment through private property to the south.<br/><br/>Lack of associated habitat represents a threat to the population. The lack of associated native vegetation makes it more likely that pollinators will be infrequent or absent. In addition, the lack of available habitat for recruitment is of concern, as the population occurs on a road reserve and private land with cleared land adjacent.<br/><br/>Firebreak maintenance impacts on Spreading Grevillea plants occurring along the firebreaks on private land.<br/><br/>Too frequent fire is a threat to the Spreading Grevillea. Adult plants regrow from a lignotuber after fire, and seed germination is presumed to be stimulated by fire. However, grevillea seed generally has a short lifespan, and if fire recurred before adult plants could replenish the seed bank and re-establish lignotuber reserves, the only known population could be seriously threatened. Grassy weeds can create a large fuel load, increasing the heat of fires. In addition, fires allow the weed species present to increase in density.","In 2002, the species was known from a single population of almost 1,500 plants. A major portion of this population (572 mature individuals) was located on private property, in a pasture paddock. It was burnt in 1995, but plants regenerated well. This area was fenced to exclude stock in 1997. The remainder of the population (920 mature individuals) occurred on adjacent Shire road reserves. The population as a whole has been disturbed but plants were healthy in 2002 (Stack and English 2003).

The species regenerates apparently from seed only (Makinson 2000). It is suspected to be disturbance opportunist and seedlings have germinated on the road reserve in grader spoil (Stack&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003).","McCutcheon's Grevillea has specific habitat requirements and is naturally geographically restricted to the ironstone soils near Busselton. This soil type has been massively impacted by vegetation clearing in the past for agriculture. There are about 1,200 ha of the soil type, of which about 90 ha remain uncleared. This represents a loss of over 90% of the area of a plant community that was originally highly restricted in distribution (Meissner and English 2005).<br/><br/>Other threats, include its vulnerability as an extremely restricted population, possible introduction of dieback disease associated with <em>Phytophthora infection</em>, fire, degraded habitat, poor survival of seedlings, weed invasion, chemical drift and accidental damage during roadworks (Environment Australia 2001, Phillimore and Papenfus 1999). Neighbouring sand mining and water extraction is a threat to the quality of the species' habitat.","The translocated populations are now well established. In 2013 the road side original population was estimated at 31 mature plants and five seedlings. The restocking population at this site had 79 adults, 119 juveniles and 17 seedlings in 2016. The translocated site had 39 adults and 38 juveniles in 2016.<br/><br/>The total population size for this species was estimated in 2007 to be approximately seven mature plants and 24 seedlings. There are additional plants in the translocated populations, however, these have not yet proved to be independently viable (capable of reproducing unassisted), so they are regarded as surviving within a 'nursery' situation (DEC 2007). There were four populations in 2007, three in nature reserves managed by the Western Australian Department of Parks and Wildlife (DPaW) for the conservation of flora and fauna and specifically for the management of McCutcheon's Grevillea. Of these three populations, two consist of translocated plants. The other population occurs in a road reserve (DEC 2007).<br/><br/>In 1993, McCutcheon's Grevillea was known from 27 plants, five on a road verge and 22 on the adjoining private property. During a survey of the population in September 1994 none of the plants were located on the private property site and the area was being grazed by cattle. The cattle were removed and the land purchased by the then Department of Conservation and Land Management in 1999. Road grading activities in 1995 reduced the population on the road reserve to four mature plants. Sixteen seedlings germinated during 1996–1997, but only ten of these had survived in 1999. In 1999 there were a total of 14 plants and four seedlings in this population (Phillimore and Papenfus 1999) and by 2003 there were 13 mature plants and 20 seedlings (Stack <em>et al. </em>2003). By June 2005 there were 24 seedlings located at this population, and seven mature plants. During 2004–2005, there were eight to ten new seedlings and an approximate loss of five to six plants due to road maintenance, traffic and natural events (DEC 2007).<br/><br/>McCutcheon's Grevillea is potentially a disturbance opportunist, as while the known wild population fluctuates in size from time to time, it is largely stable. Although road grading is putting one population at some risk, it is also generating disturbance which promotes seedling germination. These seedlings are moved from the shoulder of the road to avoid being damaged or destroyed by road traffic (DEC 2007).<br/><br/>The life span of McCutcheon's Grevillea is unknown but flowering has been noted to occur on plants grown from cuttings within approximately two years (Stack<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2003), and seedlings flower within three years in cultivation (DEC 2007).",Stable,"McCutcheon's Grevillea is known from a single location near the base of the Whicher Range, south east of Busselton, in Western Australia (Keighery and Cranfield 1996, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1998). An additional translocated population has been established 5 km from the single location and a nature reserve has been created to protect it (2000) (L. Monks pers comm.). The original population has also been augmented.<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) of this species was predicted to be less than 42 km<sup>2</sup> (DEC 2007). From this Action Plan there are no data to indicate a decline in the EOO or AOO of this highly restricted species. However, it was probably originally found in a tall mixed shrubland and the EOO would have exceeded the area in which it is now known to occur (Stack<em> et al. </em>2003). There are no data to indicate future declines in EOO. The species' distribution is highly restricted, though not severely fragmented. Nonetheless, as it is a highly restricted species which only occurs in one known location, a single disturbance event could destroy the entire known species in the wild (DEC 2007).",McCutcheon's Grevillea is known to be in cultivation in the&#160;Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority&#160;(BGPA) and several private native gardens.

BGPA currently holds 15 plants of McCutcheon's Grevillea representing five clones. The species has been extremely variable in its propagation success rate, with strike rates ranging from 0% to 100%.

Much of the suitable habitat along the Pallinup River has been cleared (Olde and Marriott 1995, Robinson and Coates 1995, Brown <em>et al. </em>1998).","The main identified threats to Maxwell’s Grevillea are habitat degradation from weed invasion (mainly wild oats, <em>Avena</em> sp.) (CALM 2001, Phillimore<em> et al.</em> 2001), and the extinction vulnerability from stochastic events (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1998). Weeds compete with this species, increase grazing pressure, and increase fire hazard due to the easy ignition of high fuel loads. (Phillimore<em> et al.</em> 2001).<br/><br/>The main potential threats to Maxwell’s Grevillea include drought and inappropriate fire regimes (Phillimore <em>et al.</em> 2001, ANRA 2007). Drought reduces flowering, seed set, population recruitment, and increases mortality (Phillmore <em>et al.</em> 2001).

It is found growing with <em>Eucalyptus marginata</em>, <em>Corymbia calophylla</em>, <em>Banksia grandis</em>,<em> Hakea lasiantha</em>, <em>Xanthorrhea preissii</em>, <em>Acacia pulchella</em> and <em>A. drummondi</em><em>i</em>.&#160;<br/><br/><em>Grevillea rara</em> is believed to be an obligate seeder, based upon the ecology of its nearest relatives (G. Keighery pers. comm.). Adult plants are apparently killed by fire, though no research has been conducted on the taxon's response. Regeneration is therefore largely from seed and time since fire is important, as intervals between fire need to be sufficient to enable regeneration of the seed bank.<br/><br/>Further reports indicate that the taxon is a disturbance opportunist. Populations 1a and 1b, which grow on the wall of Harris Dam, were reportedly transported in topsoil from the reservoir basin prior to inundation. In addition, several populations have been found in disturbed areas, such as road verges.","The main threats are road and firebreak maintenance, invasive weeds and inappropriate fire regimes.<br/><br/>Road, dam wall and firebreak maintenance threatens populations growing on the Harris River dam wall and all road reserve populations. Potentially harmful activities include grading, construction of drainage channels and the slashing of roadside or dam wall vegetation. Several of these actions also encourage weed invasion. Past activities have destroyed five plants in Population 3 by grading, and several plants have been slashed during dam maintenance. Liaison with land managers will continue to ensure the species is protected.<br/><br/>Weed invasion is a minor threat to all populations. Weeds suppress early plant growth by competing for soil moisture, nutrients and light. They also exacerbate grazing pressure and increase the fire hazard due to the easy ignition of high fuel loads that are produced annually by many grass weed species. Recovery actions to address weeds will be introduced if the threat becomes more severe. <br/><br/>Inappropriate fire regimes may affect the viability of populations. It is not known how the species responds to fire; however an overly frequent fire regime is likely to seriously damage the population by killing plants before they reach maturity and produce seed to start a new generation or recruitment. An approved burn in state forest by the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) to reduce fuel load and protect adjacent properties, was conducted in spring 2004. Fifteen plants at population 1b and up to 20 plants at population 3 were burnt. While a visual post-burn survey was conducted, indicating that <em>Grevillea rara</em> plants were resprouting, a Rare Flora Report Form (RFRF) was not completed, resulting in the species response to fire to remaining largely unknown.","The species was first collected north of Collie in 1988 from two locations, which have since been flooded as part of the construction of Harris Dam. In 1994, the species was rediscovered growing on the Harris Dam wall, adjacent to the car park. Since rediscovery, five additional populations have been located in State Forest surrounding the Harris Dam.

Population 2 occurs on Harris River Dam road, and population 3 occurs on the Collie-Tallanalla road.<br/><br/>DEC’s Threatened Flora Seed Centre (TFSC) has 765 <em>Grevillea rara</em> seeds, collected on 20th December 1996 and stored at –18°C. Germination rates hardly varied with storage time from the initial rates (96%) to the rates of the germination trial in 2004, after seven years in storage (95%), although a presumed outlying trial was conducted a year after the first in which the germination rate was as low as 76%. Germinants produced were then sent to the Botanical Garden and Parks Authority (BGPA) as live specimens. <br/><br/>BGPA currently has 5 live specimens in their gardens, ranging in age from 2 – 10 years of age (1 ~10yrs, 3 ~3yrs, 1 ~2yr). All came as germinants from DEC’s TFSC, and were propagated from seed collected along the Harris River road.<br/><br/>There have been extensive surveys in the vicinity of current populations. In 1997, 26 hours was spent over several days surveying watercourse areas within a radius of 20 km south of Collie by Diana Papenfus and two DEC District staff. There were also opportunistic surveys conducted in the area.

The decline mainly due to continuing decline in the area and quality of habitat, the number of locations and individuals. The main threats are disease, inappropriate fire regimes, drought, recreational activities and grazing.","<em>Isopogon uncinatus</em> is found in seasonally damp soil, shallow sandy-clay over granite, or gravelly soil from decomposed laterite over granite, in saddles between summit rocks. Associated vegetation is heath, typically stunted Jarrah scrub&#160;(Robinson and Coates 1995). Some variation in morphology exists between populations.<em> Isopogon uncinatus</em> plants in Torndirrup National Park are very small compared with those in other subpopulations.","Albany Cone Bush are threatened from dieback (<em>Phytophthora&#160;cinnamomi</em>) and aerial canker at some subpopulations' locations, and other populations may be affected in the future as well. Inappropriate fire may affect the long-term viability of populations. Seed germinates following fire and would be rapidly depleted if fires recur before regenerating or seedling plants reach maturity and replenish the soil seed bank, although that occasional summer fires are needed for the long-term&#160;conservation of this species (TSSC 2001). Drought may directly impact on the species due to poor flowering, seed set and recruitment, and by increasing the mortality of adult plants and seedlings. Recreational activities that result in the crushing of plants by trampling and turning vehicles have the potential to impact on Population 3. The placement of a barrier at the site was deemed impractical due to vehicles driving around the barrier (Phillimore, R. and Brown, A. 2001). Although the impact of grazing by herbivores is unclear, as one plant at Population 6 has been grazed (S. Barrett pers. comm. 2019).","<em>Isopogon uncinatus&#160;</em>is currently known from nine subpopulations totalling fewer than 100 mature individuals.&#160;Two subpopulations were known in 1988, and three more subpopulations were found in 1992 and 1993.&#160;In 1992, it was noted that many adult plants at one subpopulation were dying from unknown causes.

In 1995, 1999 and 2000, CALM staff discovered four further subpopulations. In summer 1997, a fire burnt most most of the subpopulations in Torndirrup National Park, with only a small number of adult plants surviving. Recruitment of seedlings at Torndirrup National Park was observed in 1999 and 2000. Few adult plants are present at a subpopulation but numerous seedlings have appeared.

The possible impacts of grazing on the species remain unresolved as in 2000 there was no proposal to regulate or modify grazing practices on leasehold land.&#160;Rabbits have been recorded as grazing on the species and may be implicated in the lack of observed seedling recruitment (NSW NPWS 2000). Goats, as generalist browsers, are also a potential threat to the species if their densities increase.<br/><br/>While it is likely that fire intensities and frequencies have been altered in the last 100–150 years, the nature and consequences of these changes for this species is unknown.

113310165,113180064,Macadamia integrifolia,Vulnerable,D1,2020,2019-02-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Vulnerable on account of its population size, suspected at potentially fewer than 1,000 mature individuals.","The Macadamia nut is found within lowland warm complex notophyll vine forest and Araucarian notophyll vine forest, which occur on basic and intermediate volcanics and alluvia in higher rainfall areas of southeast Queensland. This species occupies all topographic positions including ridges, scree slopes, foot slopes, gullies, benches and riverine terraces. Soils are predominantly alluvial or volcanic, well drained, often with significant surface exposure of rock fragments. Slope and aspect vary. Elevation range is 5 to 600 m. Within suitable habitat, it is typically scantily distributed within the vegetation matrix.<br/><br/>Both introduced European honey (<em>Apis mellifera</em>) and native bees <em>Trigona</em> spp. appear to be the main pollinators, with native bees being superior pollinators. Seed dispersal is by small rodents and gravity fall, probably with some assistance from local stream flooding, although viable nuts tend not to float. There is evidence that the species prefers rainforest eco-tones where light levels are higher, however these areas are also relatively more fire prone. Hybridization has been documented between <em>M. integrifolia</em> and <em>M. ternifolia</em>, and between <em>M. integrifolia</em> and <em>M. tetraphylla </em>in areas where their range overlap. Natural inter-specific hybridization has been observed to occur in areas of range overlap between <em>M. integrifolia </em>and <em>M. </em><em>tetraphylla</em>, and between <em>M. integrifolia</em> and <em>M. ternifolia</em> particularly where both species co-occur within a rainforest patch.<br/><br/>While small populations may be able to maintain themselves in a fragmented landscape where distances between patches are small, larger distances are not conducive to gene flow by pollen sufficient to maintain the genetic integrity of populations. The contrasting habitat matrix between populations may prevent dispersal of seed between these populations, except down creek lines. Therefore, if chance events lead to local population extinction, populations are not likely to be able to be replenished from neighbouring populations (Costello <em>et al. </em>2009).","The major threats facing <em>M. integrifolia</em> have arisen as a consequence of land clearing, and are shared by the rainforest community that co-occurs with the species. These include loss and fragmentation of habitat, with associated consequences such as change in community composition, habitat degradation due to edge effects, weed invasion, reduction in connectivity among populations, and potentially reduced gene flow through changes in pollination and dispersal vectors. Weeds such as Lantana (<em>Lantana camara</em>) and Camphor Laurel (<em>Cinnamomum camphora</em>) dominate habitat and change fire regimes.<br/><br/>Adjacent land uses such as grazing, urban development, or cropping (with their associated impacts of herbicide usage, nutrient runoff from fertilizers, and changed hydrology) can adversely affect remnant patches of rainforest vegetation. Many recorded <em>M. integrifolia</em> sites are located in small patches of remnant vegetation that are too small in area and/or too degraded to be mapped as remnant vegetation. At several sites the population comprises a number of single trees retained for their edible nuts when the original vegetation was cleared.<br/><br/>Only a minority of recorded <em>M. integrifolia</em> sites are located within protected areas, and these are often threatened by weeds and fire. Macadamia trees can be killed by intense or too frequent fires.&#160;<br/><br/>Threats to the genetic resources of <em>M. integrifolia</em> include loss of individuals and populations through ongoing habitat degradation, inbreeding depression in small and/or isolated populations and inappropriate selection of genetic material (i.e. a small number of genetically diverse individuals) for reintroduced populations sourced from <em>ex situ</em> gene banks (Costello <em>et al.</em> 2009). A potential threat to the species is genetic homogenisation of wild stock by mixing with widespread orchard strains. Widely-cultivated varieties of threatened species, are often represented by only one or two genotypes selected for a certain trait. Introgression of these genes into wild populations could cause genetic homogenisation and/or disruption of local genetic adaptations (see for example Whelan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).<br/><br/>It is anticipated that global warming will significantly alter the distribution of rainforest ecosystems in Australia. Macadamia populations at the extreme of an individual species’ latitudinal range may be affected by climate-induced variation in temperature and rainfall.&#160;Finally, climate change may exacerbate other existing threats such as fire and weeds. For example, climate change may alter the distribution and abundance of some weeds, particularly exotic vines at remnant edges, creating additional concerns for land managers seeking to conserve populations in small fragments.","The Macadamia Nut occurs as a scattered rare to occasional tree, and populations sizes are difficult to estimate (Barry and Thomas 1994).

Macadamia nuts are often associated with Hawaii, because the trees were exported there in the 1880s, and Hawaii dominated global production of the nuts from the 1930s until the 1980s, at one time producing 90% of the world’s commercial supply (Courteau 2012). In China it is cultivated in Guangdong, Hainan, Taiwan and Yunnan (Huaxing and Weston 2003).",Terrestrial,"Macadamia Nut is conserved in at least four reserves in south-east Queensland (Nicholls Scrub National Park, Triunia National Park, Mt Cooroy Conservation Park and Mount Bauple National Park) but these are all small (Barry and Thomas 1994).

Soils based on volcanic parent material (mostly basalt, but also trachyte, andesite, tuff and rhyolite) are of high fertility but somewhat thin or skeletal with often extensive exposure of rock fragments at the surface. Surface soils tend to be dark, of varying textures (sandy loams to light clays), slightly acid (pH 5.5–7.0) and well drained (Barry and Thomas 1994).<br/><br/>A survey of seven populations in the Cooroy to Maleny district of the Sunshine Coast (Barry and Thomas 1994) found that the species was primarily located on moderate to steeply inclined hillslopes and footslopes as well as steep to very steep tor or talus slopes at 100–320 m (mostly less than 200 m) above sea level (asl) in altitude. The Mary Cairncross Park site is atypical in that the species grows on flat to gentle undulating plateau at 430 m asl (Barry and Thomas 1994).<br/><br/>Associated vegetation is subtropical rainforest, mostly complex notophyll vineforest of varying height and development (15–40 m). An emergent rainforest tree layer may be present. Most sites are associated with a White Booyong (<em>Argyrodendron trifoliatum</em>) - Red Heart (<em>Dissilaria baloghioides</em>) alliance, common throughout the Blackall Range area (Barry and Thomas 1994). The vegetation at Mt. Pinbarren differs from the remaining sites as it involves Araucarian microphyll-notophyll mixed tall closed forest, though floristically the site shares many species in common with other recorded sites for this species (Barry and Thomas 1994).<br/><br/>Individuals can live for over 100 years, with a juvenile period of six years (Queensland CRA/RFA Steering Committee 1997).<br/><br/>Flowering in the species has been recorded from June to October with fruits from December to March (Barry and Thomas 1994, Forster <em>et al.</em> 1991). Pollination occurs via both native (<em>Trigona</em> spp.) and introduced European (<em>Apis mellifera</em>) honey bees (Costello<em> et al.</em> 2009).<br/><br/>The species reproduces from seed, which remains viable for one to six months, and seeds are dispersed by streams or rodents (Barry and Thomas 1994; Queensland CRA/RFA Steering Committee 1997).<br/><br/>Seedlings have only occasionally been recorded during surveys of wild populations (Barry and Thomas 1994). Adult plants are recorded to resprout when damaged (Queensland CRA/RFA Steering Committee 1997).","This species&#160;faces habitat modification by weeds, altered fire regimes, loss of connectivity between populations, and reduced gene flow where pollinators or dispersers have been affected. It is unclear whether biological threats,&#160;such as insects and fungus, are exacerbated by these threatening processes. Riparian and riverine corridors, once critical habitat linkages, have been extensively cleared for agriculture and subsequent urban development, especially in the Sunshine Coast lowlands. Remnant notophyll vine forests are prone to invasion by weed trees such as Camphor Laurel (<em>Cinnanmomum camphora</em>) and weed vines such as Cat’s claw Creeper (<em>Macfadyena ungiscati</em>) on disturbed margins and edges. Many remnants are often too narrow to be mapped at 1:10 000 scale which places constraints on identification of habitat sites. Enhancing habitat linkages and providing appropriate management and protection of small linkage populations is considered important for maintenance of meta-population structure. <br/><br/>Habitat in western areas of the species distribution has also been extensively cleared for pasture, cropping and forestry. These remnants can be degraded by weed infestation in conjunction with wildfire damage on margins.","The total population is estimated to be between 1,000–2,000 mature individuals (Costello <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;Approximately 20 small, distinct populations are known, with around 5-20 mature specimens at each locality. Significant clusters occur in the Blackall Range Group with similarly important cluster populations in the Gympie/Kin Kin Group and Nambour/Buderim Group (densest cluster population). The area incorporating the Gympie/Kin Kin group including Mothar Mountain, Woodum Range and Mt Pinbarren is considered significant due to the genetic isolation of these populations from other species of Macadamia (Costello <em>et al. </em>2009).",Decreasing,"The Small-fruited Queensland Nut is endemic to Queensland. Historically, the species was recorded east of the Main Divide from Kin Kin, near Gympie; and south to the Pine River, north of Brisbane. Following extensive habitat clearing, the species is now considered extremely rare in the wild and is restricted to an area between Mount Pinbarren (northern extent) and Mary Cairncross Park near Maleny (southern extent) (Barry and Thomas 1994).","Macadamia nuts are produced by the closely related species <em>M. tetraphylla</em>, which is sometimes grown commercially, and <em>M. ternifolia</em>, but the bulk of commercial production is from <em>M. integrifolia</em>.",Terrestrial,"The following is a list of objectives identified in the Southern Macadamia Species Recovery Plan aimed at the recovery of the Small-fruited Queensland Nut (in conjunction with three other Macadamia species) (Costello <em>et al.</em> 2009): identify and evaluate the extent and quality of southern macadamia species populations and their habitat; reduce and manage the major threatening processes affecting southern macadamia species habitat; increase knowledge of threatened southern macadamia species and their ecology to effect their conservation and management; improve community awareness and understanding of threatened southern macadamia species, especially the management requirements of these species; manage, monitor and evaluate the Southern Macadamia Species Recovery Plan.",Australasian,,false,false,Global

Seed dispersal is by small rodents and gravity fall, probably with some assistance from local stream flooding. This species&#160;has moderate to high genetic diversity recorded within the species and its populations, however very low genetic differentiation between populations has been recorded at a regional scale.

Some roadside populations are subject to road widening and ongoing maintenance (slashing, spraying).<br/><br/>Furthermore, the diversity of this species habitats presents complex challenges to effectively manage threatening processes. Those coastal populations found in littoral rainforest are highly susceptible to fragmentation and edge effects resulting from clearing for urban development and other land uses. These areas are also vulnerable to invasion by aggressive weeds, such as lantana and asparagus fern, which can modify remnant structure and composition. In NSW, this species has been identified as a species at risk from bitou bush (<em>Chrysanthemoides monilifera</em>).<br/><br/>Populations that occur in wet sclerophyll forest (WSF) face contentious views over how fire should be managed in this vegetation type. Recently, the southeast Queensland Fire and Biodiversity Consortium published fire management guidelines for WSF based on a fire frequency of 20-100 years. Similar work has recently been completed by the NSW Hotspots Fire Project for Northern Rivers’ vegetation communities. The proliferation of woody weeds at remnant edges can provide sufficient fuel to increase both fire frequency and intensity in these remnants. Groups such as the Brisbane Rainforest Action and Information Network have experimented with replacing degraded remnant edges with layered native edge plantings designed to provide sufficient lateral branching and leaf massing to ‘seal’ remnant edges (Donatiu pers. comm. 2008), but such closure has yet to be attempted in WSF remnants.<br/><br/>The species is threatened by genetic pollution from cultivated plantation of <em>Macadamia integrifolia.</em>","Total population size is estimated to be between 1,000–2,000 mature individuals with approximately 75 key populations with around 5–20 mature specimens at each locality.<br/><br/>Populations at any given location tend to be small, generally with fewer than 20 individuals (P.

It is thought to have a restricted extent of occurrence (EOO) of 21 km<sup>2</sup>, and occur in potentially just one location, based on the the threat of a large fire event.","It occurs at high altitudes in the eastern section of the Stirling Range. Habitat is low dense heath and scrub on a rocky shallow soil over schist and is part of the Critically Endangered Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) “Eastern Stirling Range Montane Heath and Thicket Community”. Although mature individuals do not survive fire events (Evans <em>et al.</em> 1999), and the species is presumed not to be lignotuberous (Robinson and Coates 1995), the persistence of a soil seed bank after fire has been reported for this species (Barrett and Cochrane 2007), which has been defined as an obligate seeder (Evans <em>et al.</em> 1999).<br/><br/>The species has a juvenile period (time to first flowering) of ‘more than six years’ (see Evans<em> et al. </em>1999), with observations by Stack and Brown (2000) indicating an approximate 10 year interval between germination and the production of flowers or seed. Stack and Brown (2003) suggest 10 years may be a minimum interval between fires, after a 2002 survey of two populations indicated neither had flowered 11 years after fire. In comparison to growth rates at lower altitudes or in more sheltered areas, growth rates on the exposed summit and plateau areas are extremely slow, particularly for obligate seed regenerating species (Barrett 1996). The length of time required for many species in the ecological community to reach maturity following fire, combined with deaths of juveniles from dieback, suggests a long fire-free interval (at least 12 years, to a maximum interval of 25 years) is required for this ecological community (Barrett 2000).","All known populations have been infected with dieback disease&#160;<em>Phytophthora cinnamomi</em> (Shearer <em>et al</em>. 2007). The impact of that threat is exacerbated by a frequency and severity of fire events incompatible with the successful propagation of this long-lived obligate seeder species (Stack and Brown 2003). Human presence in the area (and potentially movement of other species through the landscape) pose a threat mainly insofar as they transport <em>P. cinnamomi</em> from infected areas.<br/><u><br/>Disease<br/></u>It is moderately to highly susceptible to the dieback pathogen, which kills susceptible plants by invading their root systems and severely reducing their ability to take in water and nutrients (Stack and Brown 2003). Many other species in the Montane Heath and Thicket Community are also affected by the pathogen which spreads through root-to-root contact and through free water flow (Stack and Brown 2003).<br/><br/><u>Fire<br/></u>Fire events occurred in the eastern Stirling Range in February 1972 and April 1991 (Barrett 2000), and in 2000 (Stack and Brown 2003). All were widespread leaving only small remnants of unburnt vegetation (Barrett 2000) or damaging most populations (Stack and Brown 2003). Because this species is an obligate seeder with a long juvenile period (Evans <em>et al. </em>1999), fire occurring as frequently as once in a decade is suspected to adversely affect the species’ survival. In addition to the direct threats of frequent fire, field observations suggest that fire in areas where <em>P. cinnamomi</em> is already present increases the susceptibility of the vegetation at the site to infection and dieback (S. Barrett pers. comm. in Stack and Brown 2003, DoEE 2008), and may also lead to increased rabbit numbers, based on anecdotal evidence of increased rabbit populations following the 1991 and 2000 fires (DoEE 2008).<br/><br/><u>Human activities<br/></u>Recreational use (hiking, camping and rock climbing) of the Stirling Range has historically been high (Stack and Brown 2003, DoEE 2008). The most pressing impact of this recreational use is the spread of <em>P. cinnamomi </em>via soil transfer on the shoes of visitors to the area (especially where path drainage is not managed and soil is wet) (Stack and Brown 2003). There appears to be evidence to suggest a correlation between accessibility of peaks to recreational users and severity of infection rates (Barrett 2000). Other impacts include informal path formation and path erosion, towards the summit areas of the peaks (Barrett 2000). To a lessor degree, bare-ground occurrences, camp-fire remains, and litter were found to have had minor impacts (Barrett 2000). Citing work by Sprecht (1963), Barrett (2000) noted increases in soil fertility due to the accumulation of phosphate and nitrogen levels in the soil, which was suspected to be due to human excreta. Minor changes in soil fertility could advantage weed and sedge species (Barrett 2000) in what is ‘naturally nutrient poor soil’ (Stack and Brown 2003).<br/><br/><u>Local fauna<br/></u>Grazing by unidentified herbivores was a known threat to some populations in 2003 (Stack and Brown 2003); in an assessment of the Eastern Stirling Range Montane Heath and Thicket Community within which the species persists, DoEE (2008) note widespread evidence of grazing by rabbits and possibly <em>Setonix brachyurus</em> (quokka) impacting health and regeneration of the species. There was also a potential but small threat from trampling by fauna (Evans <em>et al</em>. 1999), and a potential risk that mobile, ground-dwelling species could act as vectors in the spread of <em>P. cinnamomi</em>.","The type collection of <em>Persoonia micranthera</em>&#160;was made from the Stirling Range in 1964 and Peter Weston described the species in 1985. Surveys between 1980 and 1997 failed to find plants outside the small area of known subpopulations. An intense fire in April 1991 burnt all the known subpopulations of <em>Persoonia micranthera</em> on Bluff Knoll leaving just three adult plants intact in a small unburnt pocket (Subpopulation&#160;3). Surveys were conducted in 1994, 1995 and 1996 to assess postfire regeneration. Although no seedlings were found at that time (Barrett 1996), two seedlings were recorded at Subpopulation&#160;1 and approximately 150 seedlings were recorded at Subpopulation&#160;3 in 1997. An additional subpopulation of 39 juvenile plants was located in 2000 (Subpopulation 4), and at that time two juveniles were discovered at Subpopulation&#160;2.<br/><br/>In 1999 three subpopulations were known, estimated to hold only three adults and approximately 150 seedlings (Evans&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). In October 2000 another intense fire burnt most subpopulations. However, six mature plants survived the fire and approximately 350 juveniles were located. A small number of plants that had germinated in response to the 1991 fire flowered for the first time in 2001. By 2007 updated estimates indicated five subpopulations, two with fewer than 10 mature plants, one with fewer than 100, and two with over 100 individuals (Shearer <em>et al.</em> 2007).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Western Australia, where it occurs on peaks in the eastern Stirling Range of Stirling Range National Park (SRNP) (Barrett <em>et al.</em> 2008; P.

Monitoring of the impact of phosphite applications at Population 3 between 1997 and 2000 showed 100% survival of plants. Note: survival was also high in the three control quadrats (90%). Due to the continuing threat from <em>P. cinnamomi</em> these areas will continue to be sprayed at regular intervals through the DCLM’s phosphite program.<br/><br/>There are currently no seed collections of <em>Persoonia micranthera</em> at either DCLM’s Threatened Flora Seed Centre (TFSC) or the Botanic Garden and Parks Authority (BGPA).

Barrett and given to the BGPA who currently have 40 plants of <em>Persoonia micranthera</em> from 11 clones. Results of propagation have been extremely variable, ranging from 0 to 100% (A.

In addition, one of the main subpopulations (""population 1"") was unlikely to be impacted by mining as a consequence of negotiations that would result in conservation management of the site. When that process was concluded all subpopulations would be on conservation land (Stack and English 2003).

It often occurs as scattered individuals at low densities. Flowering occurs from November to April, but can flower as late as July (ABRS 2017). It is an obligate regenerator, where all existing plant mass is burnt during a fire event, causing it to rely on soil-stored seeds for recruitment and germination (NSW DEC 2005). Maturity is expected to be reached in about ten years.&#160;Abundance of individuals at a site appears to be related to disturbance history, with sites with higher disturbance containing a larger abundance (OEH 2017).","The main threat affecting this plant is habitat loss and fragmentation, commonly through land clearing for residential development or sand mining. It is also affected by the plant pathogen&#160;<em>Phytopthora cinnamomi</em>&#160;and a mix of unrestricted and inadequately restricted access to its habitat, resulting in damage to and death of plants due to recreational activities, arson, and rubbish dumping. Increased fire frequencies harm individuals and disrupt life cycle processes, and feral honeybees may reduce seed set through inefficient pollen transfer and dispersal (Paton 2000, NSW DEC 2005). Too infrequent fire may also be a threat due to the relatively short life of the seedbank (S. Douglas, 2019). This species is also threatened by invasive weeds, including <em>Andropogon virginicus</em>, <em>Eragrostis curvula</em>. Some&#160;habitat losses have been quantified in part by NPWS (2002).&#160;Agnes Banks Woodland and Castlereagh Scribbly Gum Woodland&#160;are&#160;the vegetation communities that support the majority of&#160;<em>P. nutan</em>s.&#160;These&#160;have been reduced to only 15.9% and 52.7% respectively of their pre-European settlement extent&#160;due mainly to mining and rural-residential land use.&#160;Assessment of more recent mapping by OEH (2013) indicates that these figures remain roughly correct.&#160;The mining of large areas that previously supported Agnes Banks Woodland would have resulted in the loss of considerable numbers of&#160;P<em>. nutans</em>&#160;(DEC 2005).&#160;Known and inferred extinction of local populations are noted by DEC (2005). Further extinctions since 2005 are highly likely (Douglas 2019).<br/><br/>Across its range, the estimated area of potential habitat (i.e. suitable vegetation community and suitable soil type)&#160;for&#160;<em>P. nutans&#160;</em>is currently 5,300 ha in the north of the species’ range and 573 ha in the south of the species’ range&#160;(DEC 2005).&#160;“These values considerably overestimate the ‘Area&#160;Of&#160;Occupancy’ of&#160;<em>P. nutans</em>&#160;given that the species will not occupy all of these areas at a particular point in time, and some of this potential habitat may not be suitable habitat (e.g. may be subject to high fire frequency)” (DEC 2005). These calculations also rely on the accuracy of regional-scale vegetation maps, which are themselves constrained by coarse scale geology and soil maps, inherently conferring a significant margin of error. There has also likely been considerable removal and degradation of habitat since 2005, both legal and illegal.","An estimated twenty seven populations<em>&#160;</em>have been recorded historically, with over 5500 individuals in total (NSW DEC 2005). These are not all extant or viable. Seven populations reside within conservation reserves, while the remaining populations are on private property or unoccupied crown land. At least one subpopulation is within a Biobanking reserve (Moorebank). Most mature individuals occur within two populations of &gt;500 individuals, while many of the remaining populations have &lt;50 individuals (NSW DEC 2005). However, these estimates are just snapshots in time, and may no longer be accurate. The species tends to decline in number with long fire intervals, but may experience a 'boom' post-fire. DEC's estimates in 2005 do not appear to have adequate regard to this variability.<br/><br/>Since 2005, further survey effort has documented some additional populations or at least extensions to known populations, and whilst an estimate of individuals is of relatively little merit because of the species’ ecology, an updated estimate may be at least 50% greater than that given in DEC (2005).<br/><br/>The species is declining overall due to on-going habitat removal and degradation.

However, the species regenerates profusely after fire from seed, but also regenerates occasionally without fire, so that stand replacement can occur with or without burning. The time to seeding for obligate seeding species from south-western Western Australia is variable and poorly known for individual species (Gosper <em>et al</em>. 2018), but observations suggest seed is produced within five years (N. McQuoid, M. French pers. comm. 2018). There is no documentation of frequent burning causing the collapse of obligate seeding species in south-western Australia (Gosper <em>et al</em>. 2018). The likelihood that successive wildfires will occur in the habitat of this species within 5 years is unlikely given the infertile substrate combined with the extremely slow accumulation of fuel in similar, low productivity environments (O'Donnell <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p>",Stable,"This species is known from from the Tookle-Jenna Rock locality, near Israelite Bay area in Western Australia (Nicolle and French 2012).",Eucalypts are culturally important to the Indigenous Australians for a great variety of uses and meanings.,Terrestrial,All known subpopulations occur within Cape Arid National Park and Nutsland Nature Reserve (Nicolle and French 2012).,Australasian,,false,false,Global

This species is only known from the the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales where it grows in low heathlands or the margins of heathland and woodland. All individuals occur on gentle slopes with pale-grey sandy loam over white-grey clay.,"The Mongarlowe individuals are thought to be threatened by visitation pressures (Department of Environment and Climate Change 2010). At the Windellama site, the main threat to the two plants has been past habitat loss and degradation associated with clay mining and associated activities that have operated since 1995. Impacts included altered drainage, silt deposition near and around the base of the plants and dust deposition on the foliage (DECC 2010). All plants are located largely within uncleared land that remains unsuitable for agriculture. It can therefore be assumed that agriculture has not been a past threat to the species (DECC 2001). Some individual plants have fruited and produced viable seed, although seedlings have not been observed for any plants. This is not uncommon for long-lived mallee species and should not be considered a threat (R. Fensham pers. comm. 2019).","<p>  </p><p>The details of the assessment procedure are provided in Supplementary Information (attached).&#160;The habitat of this species includes soils and landscape positions that correspond to ‘unproductive habitats’, which have not declined due to agriculture (see Habitats and Ecology).

The three sites near Mongarlowe each comprise a single plant that are about 2 km apart. The site near Windellama has three individuals; two are 10 m apart and one is 40 m farther. It has been suggested that habitat of this species has been cleared  near the Windellama site due to mining.

It has a broad extent of occurrence (EOO) but is locally patchy (Loneragan 1990). The area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is less than 2,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(AVH 2021). It is now listed as endangered in South Australia<em>. </em>Australian Sandalwood is one of the most highly prized species of sandalwood in the world, second only to Indian Sandalwood,&#160;<em>S. album</em>, a species of tropical environments.<em>&#160;Santalum spicatum</em>&#160;is sought after for its fragrant heartwood and oil and has been exported from Western Australia to Asia for nearly two hundred years (since 1845). Harvesting of this species is entirely destructive, the whole tree and roots being removed (Loneragan 1990). It was once the state’s biggest export item and continues to contribute to the state’s economy. However, this species has naturally very low regeneration, is hemi-parasitic (that is, it needs to parasitise another shrub/tree species) and has a very slow growth rate. To date, all commercial harvest of this species has been from wild individuals that are typically between 90–115+ years of age, the time it takes to reach a marketable size (Loneragan 1990). Regeneration has been significantly reduced due to grazing of seedlings by introduced, and native, herbivores, consequently, there has been very little natural regeneration outside of conservation reserves since at least the 1930s (Kealley 1991). Legislative protections, plantations (which are soon to come of marketable size), active regeneration operations and measures to control introduced herbivores have been introduced, however, legal and illegal harvest of this species is occurring at more than six times the recommended level by the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DEC 2012).<br/><br/>Publicly raised concerns regarding the sustainability of the wild harvest of this species have been circulating for more than 100 years, yet wild harvest has continued throughout most of this period. Current population estimates are difficult, the last population estimate was set at 23 million (Kealley 1991) and many thousands of tonnes of mature plants have been removed since then with little wild regeneration. Efforts to facilitate regeneration in the wild are continuing, however, germination and establishment of this species is complex and dependent on suitable host species and 2–3 years of repeated high rainfall, so there is likely to be a generational gap of 100–200 years before the effects of past and current threats are ameliorated (Standing Committee on Environment and Public Affairs 2014).<strong> </strong>Furthermore, herbivore consumption, land use change, increasing drought and aridity and increased fire frequencies remain a threat to this species. Historic agricultural land-use change has not been included in this assessment because of a lack of definitive information on the impact of the species.&#160;<a>Consequently, this species is assessed as Vulnerable A2 due to its past population having reduced by more than 30% in the last three generations (300 years).&#160;</a>Given the lack of plants in the lower size classes, the observed lack of regeneration in the wild (Kealley 1991, DEC 2012), and the slow maturation times, its population decline is likely to continue over the next 100–200 years (DEC 2012), with a 30-49% decline expected over a 300 year period (three generations) including the past and the future (1821–2121). It is, therefore, assessed under&#160;<a>A4 and A3.&#160;</a></p><p></p><p></p>","<p><em>Santalum spicatum&#160;</em>is a shrub or tree (3–8 m), with dark green or glaucous, opposite leaves, stiff, spreading branchlets and small, fragrant flowers that occur in panicles (Lepschi and Barlow 2012, State Herbarium of South Australia 2021). It has a canopy diameter of 2 m (Loneragan 1990).&#160;Historical records of this species note that it was once very common to find&#160;<em>S. spicatum</em>&#160;from the Avon Valley eastwards with trees up to 8 m high and with a stem diameter of 30 cm being common (Erickson <em>et al.</em> 1973). Now, trees are typically less than half this stem size, with very few trees predicted to be in the merchantable size classes in the future (Herford <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/><em>Santalum spicatum</em>&#160;is slow growing, long lived, hemi-parasite (which means it is dependent upon a host tree&#160;for some of its resources such as water and nutrients) (Loneragan 1990, Kealley 1991, Crawford 2016). It has lateral roots that can run for 25–30 m, but are rarely more than 200 mm deep, even in deep sandy soil (Loneragan 1990). Although shallow-rooted, <em>S. spicatum </em>can survive in the arid zone and has a degree of drought tolerance due to&#160;its ability to parasitise deep-rooted species (Loneragan 1990). A number of&#160;suitable host species<em>&#160;</em>have been identified (e.g.&#160;<em>Acacia acuminata</em>,&#160;<em>A. saligna</em>,&#160;<em>A. microbotrya,&#160;</em><em>A. hemiteles </em>and <em>A. ligulata</em>), with some variation between sites as to the suitability of the different species as hosts&#160;(Brand<em> et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>This species occurs in a variety of habitats from the arid, desert interior of Western Australia, to coastal environments (AVH 2015). It grows in sand (including dunes), loam and clay, and is sometimes associated with watercourses, in shrubland, woodland and mallee (Lepschi and Barlow 2012). Mostly though, it grows on loam and among rocks in woodland and tall shrubland (Wrigley 2003). This species is notably absent, or rare, in habitats that are dominated by single species&#160;(Loneragan 1990, Kealley 1991). Genetic investigations have revealed that the SA subpopulations differ in their genetics to the WA subpopulations (Crawford 2016) and that there are two genetic<em> </em>clusters in WA. Most significant remaining stands occur in the arid zone of the northern rangelands in WA (Herford<em> et al.</em> 2015). Genetic research showed a greater level of genetic diversity and less overall population differentiation in northern compared with southern WA subpopulations. The southern subpopulations showed a relationship between drift and gene flow. Natural dispersal of&#160;<em>S. spicatum</em>'s&#160;seed&#160;leading to recruitment/regeneration is historically facilitated by small marsupials such as the nationally Endangered Brushtailed Bettong,&#160;<em>Bettongia penicillata ogilby</em>, commonly known as the Woylie (Loneragan 1990); however, the latter is extinct across most of the range of <em>S. spicatum</em>.<br/><br/>The length of time required to reach a size suitable for commercial harvest of wild trees varies between 90–115 years in the arid and semi-arid rangelands, depending on site and climatic conditions (Loneragan 1990). An average tree reaching commercial size will have a total fresh weight of 40 kg, of which 45% will be marketable, i.e. an average tree yields 18 kg of marketable timber (Loneragan 1990). Under plantation growing conditions&#160;in the more-mesic southwest Australia agricultural zone,&#160;<em>S. spicatum</em>&#160;grows much faster and may be harvested much earlier. Harvest from plantations may be possible with the trees as young as&#160;25–30 years.&#160;Trees with a diameter over bark of 127 mm constitute 69% heartwood (Loneragan 1990). Green (live) timber contains more oil and hence is more highly prized than dead timber (Lingard and Perry 2018).<br/><br/>Flowering occurs in response to rainfall and can occur in any season, however, it is mainly from March to June (Kealley 1991, Lepschi and Barlow 2012, State Herbarium of South Australia 2021).&#160; Cultivation experiments in the Perth region, found flowering to occur after 3–4 years, with seed set after 6–7 years (Barrett 1987a, Barrett 1987b). In field plantation experiments on six-year-old plants, which were irrigated during the dry season, it was noted that flowering occurred at different times on different trees and fruit took about six months to mature (Barrett 1987b). Flowers have a mild carrion-like or sweet scent and self-pollination is considered unlikely (Kealley 1991). Possible pollinators include flies, bees, wasps, ants and moths (Barrett 1987b). Another species associated with&#160;<em>S. spicatum </em>is the native Spotted Jezebel butterfly which breed and grow on&#160;<em>S. spicatum.</em>&#160;The larvae of these butterflies have been observed growing better on&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>than on any other plant species (Pobke 2007, Braby 2004), although it is not known if the adults pollinate of <em>S. spicatum</em>. Many flowers do not form fruit and large numbers of young fruit fail and are lost at all stages of development (Barrett 1987b).<br/><br/>Germination and establishment in the wild are strongly linked to several years of above average rainfall (Loneragan 1990, Kealley 1991). In cultivation, germination percentage varied considerably (between 8–93%), depending on seed characteristics and age with older seeds being significantly less viable than younger (Barrett 1987a). In the wild,&#160;only 1–5% of seed germinates outside of reserves, with the number still low (&lt;20%) inside reserves. Irrigation and seed soaking have been shown to improve germination percentage (Loneragan 1990) and seedlings grew appreciably better in the first 15–18 months if in 50–80% shade (Barrett 1987a).</p>","<p></p><p><em>Santalum spicatum&#160;</em>is threatened by unsustainable wild harvest, illegal harvesting, little or no natural recruitment (largely due to herbivory by grazing animals), fires, development and drought due to climate change. The area the species is located in has also undergone historic agricultural land-use change.<br/><br/><strong>Unsustainable, legal, wild harvest<br/></strong><em>Santalum spicatum&#160;</em>trees currently supply 40% of the global sandalwood market (Lingard and Perry 2018) and WA is projected to be the world’s leading supplier of sandalwood by 2023 (WA Police 2012). Yet, this species is very slow growing and has little or no regeneration across much of its range (Loneragan 1990, Kealley 1991). To date, all harvest of&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>has been from wild grown trees that are typically harvested when they more than a century old. Genetic investigations of the SA populations have highlighted the risk of overharvesting and the resulting genetic bottlenecks within populations reducing the genetic diversity and subsequently, the ability of the populations to respond to environmental change (Crawford 2016).<br/><br/>Concerns regarding the sustainability of the industry in Western Australia were flagged more than 100 years ago with the&#160;<em>Act to Prevent the Destruction and Export of Immature Sandalwood 1881</em>&#160;followed by the implementation of harvest quotas in 1929 with the&#160;<em>Sandalwood Act 1929.&#160;</em>Despite concerns over the long-term sustainability of the industry, the initial impetus for regulation was around maintaining market value and continuity of employment (Statham 1991). Export of&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>from WA started in 1844, with a peak annual harvest occurring in 1920 of 14,355 tonnes (Lingard and Perry 2018). In 1996 the Sandalwood Act Order set the total sandalwood harvest at a maximum of 3,000 tonnes, split equally between weights of dead and live timber. Of this, 300 tonnes was allocated to come from private property and 2,700 tonnes from Crown land (DEC 2012). A three-year review of these harvests between 2009 and 2012 found that on average the proportion of green timber harvested by FPC was 31% more than the allowed quota and 20.1% more on private property (DEC 2012, p4). In 2017 the legal harvest limit was lowered to 2,500 tonnes, with half of this quota coming from dead trees (Lingard and Perry 2018). This reduced quota of 2,500 tonnes is still 7.5 times the recommended quota (McLellan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2021).<br/><br/><strong>Illegal harvesting<br/></strong>Additional to the unsustainable legal harvest of wild&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>trees is the significant quantity of illegally harvested wood. Illegal harvesting is a key threat to&#160;<em>S. spicatum</em>&#160;conservation and it is continuing (Standing Committee on Environment and Public Affairs 2014 p.6, DAWE 2021), but just how much sandalwood is trafficked illegally is not known. One of the challenges in preventing illegal harvest of&#160;<em>S. spicatum</em>&#160;is the vast area over which illegal harvesting is conducted and the limited resources available for policing (Lingard and Perry 2018). The majority of illegally harvested&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>was thought to come from mid-western and goldfields Crown land (including pastoral leases), but also from wheatbelt conservation reserves, private land and road reserves (DEC 2012).&#160; It has been estimated that in some years, the amount of wood trafficked illegally is more than the legal amount, and as the demand for sandalwood continues to increase, so does the illegal trafficking (Wescorp 2012). <br/><br/>Social and economic inequity is an increasingly important driver in illegal harvesting (Lingard and Perry 2018). Typically, FPC contracts are awarded to parties capable of preparing appropriate tender documentation and conducting relatively large-scale capital-intensive harvest operations. Consequently, as the price of illicit sandalwood increases (a reflection of demand significantly exceeding available supply), there is an incentive for smaller-scale harvesting to operate illegally. The black market for&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>is worth millions of dollars, with most of the illegal harvest&#160;exported to Asia (DEC 2012). Illegally harvested&#160;<em>S. spicatum</em>&#160;undercuts market prices and demands for legal wood (Department of Agriculture 2014). In 2012, one country reduced its&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>order by 46% because of the large amount of illegal, discounted&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>available from WA (Wescorp 2012). Despite it being illegally sourced, local sandalwood company websites, ‘boldly’ advertise illegally sourced sandalwood (Wescorp 2012) and sell it through illegal auctions to the highest bidder (Standing Committee on Environment and Public Affairs 2014, p. 6).<br/><br/>Historically, the regulatory regime to manage sandalwood was inadequate, lacked clarity, enforcement powers and effective deterrents, that is, the consequences of illegal harvesting of&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>were relatively minor in comparison to the financial reward (DEC 2012). This has changed since it was highlighted in public submissions and final report of the inquiry into the sandalwood industry. The fines for illegal harvest are now significantly greater (Lingard and Perry 2018, Standing Committee on Environment and Public Affairs 2014). Despite these regulation changes, and increased penalties, illegal harvesting is continuing (Lingard and Perry 2018, DAWE 2021), and it is suspected that the opening of plantations will enable further passage of illegal harvest to be traded under the guise of plantation-sourced material (DEC 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Little or no natural regeneration<br/></strong>It was reported in 1991 that&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>was declining throughout its range owing to its lack of regeneration, with only limited regeneration occurring inside conservation reserves (Kealley 1991, Crawford 2016). Outside of reserves, annual levels of recruitment in 1991 was thought to be around 12,500 plants per annum, or 0.5% of a population of 23 million (Kealley 1991).<em>&#160;</em>There are several causes of this lack of regeneration, centring around loss of natural dispersers, overgrazing and complex germination requirements (Loneragan 1990, Kealley 1991). Sandalwood has specific requirements for successful seed set, germination and survival (Barrett1987b, Loneragan 1990).&#160; As these specific requirements are met only irregularly, successful regeneration is possibly cyclical and combined with the effect of environmental changes and grazing, have led to the current poor levels of regeneration and recruitment (Kealley 1991). Additionally,&#160;<em>S</em><em>. spicatum</em>&#160;is highly palatable, and heavily grazed by domestic, feral and native herbivores including sheep, goats, cattle, camels, rabbits and kangaroos (Loneragan 1990). Whilst some regeneration has been detected in conservation reserves, grazing is still occurring from rabbits and kangaroos (Loneragan 1990).<br/><br/>Naturally, germination of&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>is aided by the caching of seed by the Woylie, a small Australian marsupial that has a mutualistic relationship with&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>and is known to both disperse the seed and facilitate its recruitment. Woylies once occupied most of mainland Australia, however, it is extinct over most of its range and the decline of the Woylie is linked to limited seed dispersal of&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>(Murphy 2009)<em>.&#160;</em>&#160;Only one subspecies (<em>Bettongia penicillata ogilby)&#160;</em>remains, restricted to southwest WA with some translocated populations in South Australia and New South Wales (Yeatman and Groom 2012).<br/><br/>Based on the current stem diameters of live sandalwood in the FPC supply areas, there are very few trees predicted to be in the merchantable size classes in the future (Herford <em>et al.</em> 2015). &#160;It is anticipated that given the rate of wild harvest and the long history of poor regeneration rates, there will come a time when there are no wild sources of sandalwood, until the regeneration efforts become effective. Given the slow rate of growth of this species, this gap in wild supply could last 100 years (Standing Committee on Environment and Public Affairs 2014, p. 7).<br/><br/>Another possible factor in poor recruitment is the altered environment caused by sandalwood pulling making it poorly suited for seedling establishment. Little specific information exists on the ecological consequences of the removal of a whole <em>S. spicatum </em>tree, including its roots, from the arid ecosystem. Nor is there information on the significance of removal of dead sandalwood trees and the effect these activities have on arid zone microhabitats, soil structure and patch dynamics. Exposed arid-zone soils have lower microbial diversity and functional capacity than soils beneath canopies, which may impact ecosystem sustainability as aridity drives open-space expansion in deserts (Kushwaha 2021).&#160;&#160;Furthermore, there is an abundance of information on the importance of structure within the arid zone through existing mature plants, dead plants and rocks, with the microhabitats beneath these structures facilitating water, seed and nutrient reservoirs, along with a generally more benign microclimate within a harsh environment&#160; (Flores and Jurado 2003,&#160;Facelli and Brock 2008,&#160;Munguía-Rosas and Sosa&#160;2008,&#160;Loayza <em>et al.</em> 2017). Consequently, we can infer&#160;from other arid zone research studies that the destructive removal of canopy species like <em>S. spicatum</em>, is likely to create exposed soils and reduce the biodiverse, 'patch-like' structure of the arid zone, further threatening the survival of <em>S. spicatum </em>and other arid zone&#160;species.<br/><br/><strong>Drought, fire and climate change<br/></strong>Increasing fire frequencies, drought, and climate change (especially rainfall variability), are serious threats to regenerating and mature <em>S. spicatum</em>.&#160;Generally,&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>is well adapted to drought due to its hemiparasitic nature tapping into deep-rooted host species (Loneragan 1990). Recently, however, drought driven by a changing climate is thought to be behind large numbers of mature&#160;<em>S. spicatum</em>&#160;plants<em>&#160;</em>dying in SA, many of which are believed to have been centuries old (Corvo 2019). Additionally, <em>S. spicatum</em> is sensitive to fire (Loneragan 1990), so the increasing frequency of fires that have been observed across the arid zone, and the changing climatic structure, are serious threats to the survival and regeneration success of this species (Herford <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;</p><p></p>","<p><em>Santalum spicatum</em>&#160;is rare in SA and uncommon in WA. It was once not unusual to find large&#160;<em>S. spicatum </em>trees&#160;from the Avon Valley eastwards (Erickson <em>et al.</em> 1973). Today, it is known to have a scattered distribution across the southern two-thirds of WA, with lower densities in SA (Crawford 2016). The species originally occurred over much of the WA wheatbelt, however, clearing for agriculture and over-harvesting has reduced the species in this region to small, fragmented populations (Loneragan 1990, DEC 2012).&#160;The most significant remaining stands of naturally occurring sandalwood are in the WA rangelands, where it is on a trajectory towards being extinct in the wild (McLellan <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>Calculating the population level and change over time of&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>is difficult, in large part due to the scattered nature of its distribution, the lack of baseline data, and the limitations of the population surveys and estimates that have been undertaken. Between 1980-1984 surveys were conducted to determine the status of&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>as a resource. The total population of living&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>was estimated to be approximately 23 million live trees, of which 20.15 million were outside conservation reserves and the most dense populations were in the Goldfields, Yilgarn, Lower Murchison and Plumridge Lakes Regions (Kealley 1991).<br/><br/>Of the 2,500-tonne annual wild harvest quota,&#160;1,250 tonnes is from live trees and 1,250 tonnes from dead wood&#160;harvest (Herford <em>et al</em>. 2015, Lingard and Perry 2018).<br/><br/>To determine the population change over time, we can use the calculations from the mass of an average commercially harvested tree and divide the annual harvest by the tree mass (Loneragan 1990). An average tree reaching commercial size has a total fresh weight of 40 kg, of which 45% will be marketable, i.e. an average tree yields 18 kg of marketable timber (Loneragan 1990), the rest of the tree (foliage, twigs and branchwood) are discarded from final harvest quotas (FPC 2020). This means that as a baseline, every tonne of&#160;<em>S. spicatum</em>&#160;represents, on average, 55.5 trees.&#160;Using this as an estimate of the number of trees harvested each year (i.e. 55.5 trees/ tonne x 1,250 tonnes/ year = 69,375 trees/ year), we can create a conservative estimate that in the past 100 years (one generation), more than 6,937,500 mature live trees have been harvested.&#160;A recent study has suggested that as many as 16.6 million mature live trees have been harvested from the wild over the last 175 years (McLellan<em> et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>We know, however, that former harvest levels were much higher than the current legal harvest quota of&#160;1,250 tonnes live (and 1,250 tonnes dead) wood&#160;harvest (Lingard and Perry 2018).&#160;Furthermore, in some years, the legal quota has been exceeded by more than 30% by registered harvesters (DEC 2012) and the extent of the illegal harvest is predicted to be so high in some years that it is more than the quantity of the legal wild harvest (Wescorp 2012).&#160;Consequently, we know the loss of nearly seven million trees in a generation is a conservative estimate. Furthermore, when combined with the loss of individuals from South Australia, it seems reasonable to estimate a loss of more than 30% of the population has occurred within one generation, as reflected in the distributional change.<br/><br/>Across its range there are very low levels of regeneration, with the lowest levels being in pastoral land of the Murchison, Gascoyne and Goldfields (Kealley 1991).&#160;In South Australia, all known habitat is considered critical to this species survival, with 48 populations known from northern Eyre Peninsula. The status of these populations is unknown (only seven of which had been 'recently' revisited (Probke 2007)), however, most of the remaining <em>S. spicatum</em>&#160;individuals in SA are mature (M. O'Leary pers. comm. 2021).<br/><br/>Genetic investigations have revealed that the SA subpopulations differ in their genetics to the WA subpopulations (Crawford 2016) and that there are two genetic clusters in WA. Most significant remaining stands occur in the arid zone of the northern rangelands in WA (Herford <em>et al.</em> 2015). Genetic research showed a greater level of genetic diversity and less overall population differentiation in northern compared with southern WA subpopulations. The southern subpopulations showed a relationship between drift and gene flow.<br/><br/>Given the lack of plants in the lower size classes, the observed lack of regeneration in the wild (Kealley 1991, DEC 2012), and the slow maturation times, its population decline is likely to continue over the next 100–200 years (DEC 2012),&#160; with a 30-49% decline expected over a 300 year period including the past and the future (1821–2121).</p>",Decreasing,"<em>Santalum spicatum&#160;</em>is&#160;distributed throughout southern Western Australia (WA) and South Australia (SA). In WA it occurs from the west coast into the northern rangelands, south to the wheatbelt and east to the Nullarbor and into SA. It does not occur on the Swan Coastal Plain or in the forested southwest (Herford <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;In SA it occurs from the Nullarbor to the Gairdner-Torrens region, across the northern part of the Eyre Peninsula and into the Flinders Ranges (Pobke 2007).&#160;<br/><br/>In the southwest of this species range, where it overlaps with WA's wheatbelt, this species habitat has been cleared for agriculture and is now reduced to only occasional remnants (Loneragan 1990, Murphy 2009).&#160;It occurs in the following IBRA 7 Bioregions: AVW, CAR, COO, ESP, EYB, FLB, GAS, GAW, GES, GID, GVD, JAF, LSD, MAL, MUR, NULL, PIL, STP, SWA, YAL<br/><br/>Obtaining an accurate figure of change in distribution over time is very challenging given the remoteness and amount of area covered,&#160;and the lack of baseline data on the original extent of the population.","<p>Sandalwood species are known for their aromatic wood and Australia’s Aboriginal people use the fruit and nut of <em>Santalum spicatum</em> for food and medicinal purposes (Lingard and Perry 2018, Tucker Bush 2020). Internationally, sandalwood oil is highly prized for use in incense, perfumes, and the pharmaceutical industry. Sandalwood oil can be extracted from both live (green) and dead wood, with the yield from dead wood being lower. Higher yields of oil come from individuals growing in areas where they are slower growing (DEC 2012).<br/><br/>Wild <em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>is the source of nearly half of all sandalwood traded around the globe annually and was once WA's largest export earner (Lingard and Perry 2018, WA Sandalwood Plantations 2021). Currently the industry is valued at AUD $40 million per annum (FPC 2017, Prendergast 2021).&#160;The Western Australian Sandalwood industry has been exporting this species to China, India and other parts of Asia since 1844 (Crawford 2016, WA Sandalwood Plantations 2021), and&#160;<em>S. spicatum</em> is the second most sought after species of sandalwood, second only to Indian sandalwood,&#160;<em>S. album</em>&#160;(Crawford 2016).&#160;In SA, where&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>is at lower densities, the industry was only active between the early 1900s, and late 1940s (Crawford 2016)&#160;when it was terminated due to the near exhaustion of the species in the wild (Jeffery 2000).<br/><br/>Western Australia’s Forest Products Commission (FPC) is responsible for the commercial harvesting, regeneration, marketing and sale of wild <em>S. spicatum</em> from Crown land (including land subject to pastoral leases). The FPC is also responsible for the management of 6,000 hectares of&#160;sandalwood plantations located in the southwest, wheatbelt and mid-west regions (FPC 2020a). Of the 2,500-tonne annual wild harvest quota, FPC is responsible for harvesting 2,200 tonnes, the remaining 300 tonnes are for private harvest licence (Lingard and Perry 2018). Recently, the FPC reported an annual turnover of $122 million, with $1 million spent on sandalwood regeneration (FPC 2020a). <br/><br/>Commercial plantations of the species have been established by both FPC and private enterprises, however due to the slow growth rate, no plantations had trees of a marketable size until the current year, 2021 (Prendergast 2021).&#160;</p>",Terrestrial,"<em>Santalum spicatum is&#160;</em>not listed as threatened in WA, despite more than a century of recognition of poor regeneration (Statham 1991) and continual harvest at unsustainable levels (DEC 2012, McLellan <em>et al. </em>2021). In SA, where it was once widespread, it is now listed as Endangered due to felling for timber (SA Government 2021).&#160;<em>Santalum spicatum</em> is very well studied (Murphy 2009,&#160;Moniodis 2014,&#160;Crawford 2016), and many of the key components needed to facilitate the long-term conservation of this species are known (Loneragan 1990, Kealey 1991, Murphy 2009,&#160;Moniodis 2014,&#160;Crawford 2016).&#160;Many stakeholders are interested in the&#160;current and<em>&#160;</em>long-term viability of the species, from conservationists, the forestry industry, the value adding industry, pastoral lease holders, Aboriginal groups and the illegal traders.&#160;Alongside the remote and scattered distribution of this species, the lack of regeneration and long maturation processes, this makes the conservation and sustainable management of this species challenging.<br/><br/><strong>Addressing unsustainable harvest<br/></strong><span lang=""EN-US"">Many people within the sandalwood industry, conservation groups and private citizens, are calling for the amount of wild harvest to be substantially reduced or terminated and/or better managed, both for the purpose of conservation of the species and because there is an anticipated oversupply in the market (Christian 2016, Prendergast 2021). The wild harvest quota is not set to be reviewed until 2026, however, plantations of&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>are starting to reach a marketable size over the next one (Prendergast 2021) to five years (FPC 2020a). Once these plantations are harvested, if there is not a reduction in the wild harvest of this species, the prices for <em>S. spicatum </em>are likely to fall (Prendergast 2021). One private plantation is available for harvest now, in 2021, with an anticipated future harvest of 6,000 tonnes/annum (Prendergast 2021).<br/><br/><strong>Addressing illegal harvesting<br/></strong>Reducing the illegal harvesting of sandalwood is challenging due to the very high value of the wood. On 1 January 2019 the <em>Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016</em>&#160;and <em>Biodiversity Conservation Regulations 2018</em>&#160;replaced the&#160;<em>Wildlife Conservation Act 1950</em>&#160;and the&#160;<em>Sandalwood Act 1929</em>&#160;and their associated regulations. The new licensing regime specifies licences for taking, disturbing, supplying, possessing, processing, dealing, importing and exporting activities in relation to flora and fauna (DPAW 2019). The commercial harvesting of sandalwood is managed under the <em>Forest Products Act 2000 </em>and the&#160;<em>Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 </em>(FPC 2017). The <em>Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016</em>&#160;act&#160;significantly improves the State Government's ability to protect native species and important biodiversity assets (FPC 2020). The Act increases the penalties for illegally harvesting wild sandalwood to $200,000 for individuals and $1 million for corporations (formerly it was $200). In addition to these legislative changes, the FPC will fund an extra position to work on the enforcement of the <em>Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016</em>&#160;(Lingard and Perry 2018).<br/><span lang=""EN-US""><br/><strong>Addressing regeneration<br/></strong>Experimental investigations into the germination requirements of&#160;<em>S. spicatum</em>&#160;found that regeneration success was low with buried seeds (~20%), but was substantially higher than the germination results of natural seed fall (&lt;1% germinated) (Barrett 1987a, Loneragan 1990). From this and related research it was deduced that a key component of the successful seed germination of&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>involves burial of the seed (Loneragan 1990), a task naturally undertaken by native marsupials such as the Critically Endangered Woylie,&#160;<em>Bettongia&#160;</em><em>penicillata</em>.&#160;To combat dispersal and recruitment failures, the FPC has developed a seed burial machine to mimic the seed caching activities of the Woylie<em>&#160;</em>(FPC 2020b).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">This 'Woylie seeding machine' can cover over 850 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and sow over 5,000,000 seeds per year (Forest Products Commission 2017). Regions for regeneration projects have been identified based on a number of criteria including fire risk, and grazing pressure. Each year, following harvest, the FPC plants <em>S. spicatum</em>&#160;seeds with re-seeding commencing around September and continuing through to April (FPC 2020a).<br/><br/>Regeneration activities provide an opportunity for Aboriginal people to realise economic and cultural aspirations related to land management and protection (Feary <em>et al.</em> 2010, p. 127 reported in Lindt and Perry 2018, p. 96). To help realise these opportunities, the FPC has established a ""Sandalwood Dreaming"" component to their <em>S. spicatum </em>industry to engage Aboriginal groups to collect seed (FPC 2017) and assist in restoring sandalwood ecology, including fencing to protect from overgrazing, feral animal control, and re-seeding sandalwood nuts to ensure the sandalwood industry is maintained into the future (FPC 2020a, p.18).<br/><br/>In the 2019/2020 financial year, 1,460km of riplines were re-seeded in the Rangelands (as part of 'Operation Woylie') and 50kg of sandalwood seed was hand seeded in less accessible areas by Aboriginal planters (FPC 2020a).&#160;In 2018-2019 and 2019-20, the FPC expanded its seeding program significantly and sowed over 20 tonnes of sandalwood seed each year, with an expectation that the long term success rate of seedling establishment will be in the order of 50,000 seedlings/ year. Seedling success rate is monitored over the first summer noting that in dry years, seeds may emerge later than the first year (FPC 2020a) and that 12 month old seedlings are often yet to establish the critical connection with a host plant through an adequate haustorium (Loneragan 1990, p. 16).&#160;The FPC has reported that seedling establishment has been less than targeted due to successive years of drought in the silviculture area since 2016 (FPC 2020a).&#160;Consequently, the long term success of these reseeding projects is yet to be realised.<br/><br/>In addition to Operation Woylie and the reseeding projects managed by the FPC, a federally funded revegetation project for this species was conducted on Eyre Peninsula between 2011 and 2014 (Commonwealth of Australia 2014) and long-term rehabilitation of natural processes may be facilitated in the southern parts of the range of&#160;<em>S. spicatum</em>&#160;range by projects designed to create and/or protect habitat for the Woylie<em>&#160;</em>(Yeatman and Groom 2012).<br/><br/>Despite increased understanding and technological advancements, one of the biggest challenges to the conservation and preservation of this species in the wild is the remoteness of its distribution. Not only is this a challenge for preventing and monitoring illegal harvesting operations, but it also affects conservation efforts to facilitate regeneration (e.g. watering of host and target species and prevention of browsing by feral and domestic herbivores) (Lingard and Perry 2018). This may be at least partially addressed by imposing and enforcing licence requirements for harvesters to regenerate harvested areas and make future licences dependent upon proof of compliance (Lingard and Perry 2018).<br/><br/><strong>Research<br/></strong>Long-term research studies are being conducted by the FPC in the Goldfields and mid-west to determine the natural sandalwood population age and size structure and the benefits of seed enrichment in the Goldfields and Mid-West. Additionally, in the mid-west, where low autumn and winter rainfall can often limit germination success, a new sandalwood seeding trial has been established to determine methods to enhance moisture retention levels around the planted sandalwood and aid germination (FPC 2020a p. 24).<br/><br/>Research is underway regarding the role&#160;<em>S. spicatum&#160;</em>individuals play in<em>&#160;</em>soil fertility, moisture retention and annual plant establishment in the arid zone (G. Keighery pers. comm. 2021). Further research is being conducted into the demography of <em>S. spicatum</em> in the semi-arid and arid central and western rangelands, as well as the ecological functions that the species provide in situ particularly with regards faunal visitation and usage, and microclimatic refuge attributes (R. McLellan pers. comm. 2021).&#160;  <p><br/></p></span></span>",Australasian,,false,false,Global

The extent of occurrence and area of occupancy for the species are highly restricted and are not thought to exceed 12 km<sup>2</sup>. Inappropriate fire regimes, grazing and poor recruitment represent major threats to this species. These threats could feasibly affect the entire global population in a short time because the species is considered to be restricted to a single location. In 2013, the species was identified as Critically Endangered in Western Australia based on the small and declining population. At this time, the global population was observed to comprise 69 mature plants across two subpopulations. Following the subsequent implementation of a recovery plan, approximately 2,000 mature individuals were observed in 2017. However, in 2018, and again at the end of December 2019, two very large bushfires affected the Stirling Range National Park. Qualitative descriptions of the extent of the 2019 fire indicate that it would have entirely encompassed the larger subpopulation and it is suspected that the smaller subpopulation may also have been affected. The current number of mature individuals is not known. It is suspected that both subpopulations persist in the soil seed bank, but it is plausible that most, if not all, mature individuals and seedlings were killed as a result of the 2019 fire. As such, it is inferred that the population trend is decreasing and that the number of mature individuals is experiencing ongoing decline, despite conservation interventions. Most existing conservation actions were established to protect existing plants, rather than new growth, and management resources are now suspected to be stretched given the widespread damage caused by the large fires. At present, the population is suspected to be especially susceptible to fires and grazing of new growth. Stirling Range Wattle is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered. The conservation outlook for the species should be viewed as comparable to 2013 when the recovery plan was implemented; as such, the actions implemented, including grazing control, population monitoring, seed collection, fire management, disturbance trials, translocations, mapping of suitable habitat, and promotion of awareness and community engagement, are once again necessary and urgently required.</p>","Stirling Range Wattle is a perennial, spreading, straggly viscid shrub, growing to 3 m in height and 4 m in width. Golden inflorescenses are borne from September to November (Brown <em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Cowan and Maslin 2001, Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2008).&#160;Seeds mature early in summer, with seed dispersal close to the plant (Cochrane 2019).&#160;The species is an obligate seeder, being killed by fire and regenerating from soil-stored seed (Department of Environment and Conservation 2013).&#160;Population persistence is thus dependent on seedling recruitment from a soil-stored seed bank or from recently released seeds in the post-fire environment (Cochrane 2019).&#160;Stirling Range Wattle occurs as a component of open wandoo woodland on the lower slopes of hills or along watercourses, growing in sandy clay loam over siltstone and quartz in flat areas (Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2008, Department of Environment and Conservation 2013). The species has only been recorded from the Esperance mallee ecoregion, as delineated by Olson <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2001).","The main threats to this species have been identified as inappropriate fire regimes, grazing and poor recruitment (Department of Environment and Conservation 2013). While adult plants are naturally killed by fire periodically (Cochrane 2019), recruitment is poor, and adversely affected by grazing (Department of Environment and Conservation 2013). In the recovery plan implemented for the species in 2013, the requirement for sufficient time between fire events to allow the new seedlings to reach maturity was highlighted (Department of Environment and Conservation 2013). Given this, the successive large fires of 2018 and 2019 are inferred to have had a damaging impact on the species. Qualitative descriptions of the extent of the 40 km<sup>2</sup> 2019 fire (Croy 2020)&#160;indicate that it would have entirely encompassed the larger known subpopulation, and possibly the whole global population.&#160;As well as the suspected significant loss of mature individuals, the efficacy of existing conservation actions would have been lessened; tree guards, for example, would have been established to protect existing plants, rather than new growth. It is also not clear whether an active management plan remains in place, as the interim recovery plan was completed in 2018&#160;(Department of Environment and Conservation 2013) and management resources are suspected to be stretched given the widespread damage caused by the large fires (Logan and Dobson 2020). At present, the population is therefore suspected to be especially susceptible to fire and grazing of new growth by rabbits and/or quokka (Department of Environment and Conservation 2013). Other potential threats include dieback caused by <em>Phytophthora cinnamomi</em>,&#160;and competition from <em>Avena</em> species and Tea-tree mistletoe, and possibly habitat degradation on account of recreational activities in the national park (Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2008).","In 2013, the global population was observed to comprise 69 mature plants across two subpopulations; by contrast, in 2001, more than 1,000 individuals were observed (Department of Environment and Conservation 2013). In 2017, following the implementation of a recovery plan in 2013 (Department of Environment and Conservation 2013), one subpopulation was observed to comprise 510 plants, of which 500 were reintroduced as part of the recovery plan, and 1,500 mature plants were observed in the other subpopulation, which benefited from the implementation of grazing controls (Cochrane 2019). However, in 2018, and again at the end of December 2019, two very large bushfires affected the Stirling Range National Park (Mochan and Gubana 2018, Logan and Dobson 2020). Qualitative descriptions of the extent of the 2019 fire indicate that it would have entirely encompassed the larger subpopulation (Croy 2020). Additionally, protective back-burning undertaken in the vicinity of the Stirling Range Retreat and the Bluff Knoll Cafe may have affected the smaller, predominantly reintroduced subpopulation. The current number of mature individuals is not known. It is suspected that both subpopulations persist in the soil seed bank, but it is plausible that most, if not all, mature individuals and seedlings were killed as a result of the 2019 fire.

Two distinct subpopulations have been identified (Department of Environment and Conservation 2013), growing in the area between the Bluff Knoll turnoff from Chester Road and the Mount James track. The Stirling Range National Park is a fire-prone environment (Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions 2018). In 2018 and again at the end of December 2019, two very large bushfires affected the park, the former burning 17 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of land, and the latter more than 40 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Mochan and Gubana 2018, Logan and Dobson 2020). Qualitative descriptions of the extent of the 2019 fire indicate that it would have entirely encompassed the more southerly subpopulation. Additionally, protective back-burning undertaken in the vicinity of the Stirling Range Retreat and the Bluff Knoll Cafe may have affected the subpopulation growing near Chester Road (Croy 2020). As such, the contemporary distribution of mature individuals is not clear. It is suspected that both subpopulations persist in the soil seed bank, but it is plausible that all mature individuals and seedlings were killed as a result of the 2019 fire. Surveys are now essential to identify whether extant mature individuals have successfully re-established within the historic extent of occurrence, and where these plants occur. An altitudinal range has not been ascribed to the species, but the area in which the species is known to occur lies between 200 and 300 m asl.","In spite of detailed profiles around this species, there are no documented uses.

Prior to 2013, surveys were undertaken to identify novel subpopulations, plants were reintroduced to the smaller extant subpopulation,&#160;tree guards and fencing were placed around plants, and seeds were collected and stored at the DEC Threatened Flora Seed Centre. In 2013, a recovery plan was put in place for this species with the intention of mitigating immediate threats to the species. The actions implemented included additional grazing control, population monitoring and seed collection, as well as fire management, disturbance trials, additional translocations, mapping of suitable habitat, and promotion of awareness and community engagement (Department of Environment and Conservation 2013). Observations in 2017 indicated that the recovery plan was working effectively, with about 2,000 mature individuals observed, compared to 69 in 2013 (Department of Environment and Conservation 2013, Cochrane 2019). During this time, germplasm accessions were also collected for storage at the Millennium Seed Bank project.

The species occupies a restricted distribution, with confirmed collections only made from the Gibraltar Range and Nymboida National Parks, although unsubstantiated observations have been reported from Barool National Park and Mann River Nature Reserve. The estimated extent of occurrence for the species is 144 km<sup>2</sup>, and the area of occupancy may not exceed 28 km<sup>2</sup>; if presence of the species in Barool National Park and Mann River Nature Reserve is confirmed, these values are estimated to rise to 584 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and 80 km<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Although the species has been described as locally common in the area of Dandahra Falls, most collection records allude to small numbers of plants at collection sites, rarely exceeding 25 plants; however, the total population size is not known. The most severe current and future threat to the species at all localities is suspected to be the increasing intensity and frequency of bushfires. In 2019, up to 90% of the Gibraltar Range National Park was affected by bushfires, and the Nymboida area was also severely impacted. While many species of Acacia require fire to rejuvenate populations and to break dormancy in seeds, even fire-requiring obligate seeders can be eliminated from a site if fires are too frequent and severe.&#160;As the species has typically been observed in small numbers, and the frequency and intensity of bushfires are increasing across New South Wales, it is inferred that the extensive 2019 bushfires contributed to ongoing declines in the number of mature individuals, number of locations, and quality of habitat for the species. Although some collection sites are separated by considerable distances, and the Mann River provides a natural firebreak, it is considered increasingly plausible that the interactive effects of a large wildfire and drought could remove all individuals of the species and impede subsequent seedling survival; it is estimated that the species may be restricted to just one location, and no more than five.&#160;<em>Acacia cangaiensis</em>&#160;is therefore assessed as Endangered. Research into the impacts of the severe 2019–20 bushfire season on the population and distribution status of this species is necessary, alongside a wider evaluation of threats affecting the species. It is also important that the species is considered as part of fire management plans for the region.","Cangai wattle is a perennial shrub or tree, growing to between 2–6 m in height. It produces pale yellow or golden flowers between January and March (Tindale and Kodela 2001, POWO 2019). It occurs in open, dry sclerophyll forest, on steep rocky slopes and narrow knife-edge ridges, in skeletal soil over granite (Tindale and Kodela 2001, PlantNET 2020). The species is only known from the Eastern Australian temperate forests ecoregion, as delineated by Olson <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2001). In order to better evaluate the response of the species to fire events, necessary ecological research includes study into generation length, primary juvenile period, germination mechanism, and seed bank dynamics.","The most severe current and future threat to the species at all localities is suspected to be the increasing intensity and frequency of bushfires. Between 2007 and 2013, weekly bush-fire frequencies increased by 40% across Australia (Dutta <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). This trend is partially attributable to anthropogenic climate change, with the extreme bushfire season of 2019–20 between fourfold and ninefold more likely than it would have been in 1900 (Van Oldenborgh <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Many species of Acacia require fire to rejuvenate populations and to break dormancy in seeds (Bell and Elliott 2013)&#160;but even fire-requiring obligate seeders can be eliminated from a site if fires are too frequent and severe (Auld 1987).&#160;In 2019, up to 90% of the Gibraltar Range National Park was affected by bushfires (UNESCO 2020), and the Nymboida area was also severely affected (Jambor and Martin 2019). The impact of bushfire can be exacerbated by drought; an increase in the severity of short-duration droughts across the native distribution is predicted by 2050 (DECCW 2010). Cangai wattle, as an obligate seeder, is especially susceptible to pre-fire drought, which may reduce pre-fire reproductive output, and thus reduce the size of the seed bank available for post-fire recruitment (Gallagher 2020). As an obligate seeder, it is also considered likely to have had a significant proportion of its known population reduced to immature plants in the 2019/2020 fires, with at least 50% of its known sites or habitat burnt (Auld <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020, Gallagher 2020). This is suspected to heighten its vulnerability to stochastic losses relating to other threats, such as flooding, invasive species, erosion, and disease. The soils within the Mann River Nature Reserve and Gibraltar Range National Park are highly susceptible to erosion, especially along walking, biking, and fire trails; flooding has been documented at one collection locality near the Mann River, and&#160;introduced plants and animals have been recorded in the area (NPWS 2005, 2010).&#160;Further research into the impacts of the severe 2019–20 bushfire season on this species is necessary, as well as identification of potential threats to recovery.","The species has been described as locally common at Dandahra Falls (<em>Coveny and Whalen #16680</em>); however, at Raspberry lookout, it has been described as occasional (<em>Bean #14656</em>). The number of mature individuals documented at specific collection localities ranges from 5–22, although the number of mature individuals has not been enumerated at all collection sites. In 2019, up to 90% of the Gibraltar Range National Park was affected by bushfires (UNESCO 2020), and the Nymboida area was also severely affected (Jambor and Martin 2019).&#160;Many species of Acacia require fire to rejuvenate populations and to break dormancy in seeds (Bell and Elliott 2013)&#160;but even fire-requiring obligate seeders can be eliminated from a site if fires are too frequent and severe (Auld 1987). As the species has only been observed in small numbers, and the frequency and intensity of bushfires are increasing across New South Wales (Dutta <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016),&#160;it is inferred that the suspected large-scale loss of mature individuals associated with the 2019 bushfires may represent part of an ongoing decline in the number of mature individuals. As the impact of the 2019 fires has not yet been fully evaluated, the population trend for this species is not clear. Further research and survey work are necessary to identify subpopulation composition and trends, especially in the wake of the extensive 2019 bushfires. Monitoring for recruitment and seedling survival as part of an evaluation of post-fire recovery is urgently required.",Decreasing,"Cangai wattle<em> </em>is endemic to northeast New South Wales (POWO 2019). All documented collections have been recorded from the Gibraltar Range and Nymboida National Parks (Protected Planet 2020), specifically from the areas of Dandahra Falls, Munningyundo Point, along Cangai Road above the Cangai Boards Flora Reserve, and in the vicinity of Raspberry Lookout. An elevational range for the species has not been described, but the altitudes of collection localities range from 600–1,030 m asl. In 2019, up to 90% of the Gibraltar Range National Park was affected by bushfires (UNESCO 2020), and the Nymboida area was also severely affected (Jambor and Martin 2019). As it is suspected that the species is an obligate seeder, these fires are likely to have killed the majority of mature individuals (Auld <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). It should be noted that the species has also reportedly been observed in Barool National Park and Mann River Nature Reserve (GBIF.org 2020); however, presence of the species here has not been acknowledged in contemporary descriptions of the species distribution (PlantNET 2020), and further verification of presence in this area is necessary.",There is no use or trade information available for this species.,Terrestrial,"All documented collections of the species have been made from the Gibraltar Range National Park, inclusive of the Cangai Boards Flora Reserve, and the Nymboida National Park (Protected Planet 2020).

It is mostly confined to the Clandulla and Glen Davis areas, but has also been recorded from Yerranderie. It occupies a restricted distribution, with an estimated extent of occurrence of 2,281 km<sup>2</sup>, and an area of occupancy estimated at 48 km<sup>2</sup>. This restricted distribution is supported by a systematic sampling of the flora of northwest Wollemi National Park and its surrounds in which the species was recorded at fewer than 1% of surveyed sites. The species has been described as scattered at some collection localities, and as locally frequent at others; however, population information for the species is limited, and both the population size and the current population trend are unknown. The majority of occurrence records for the species have been reported outside of protected areas where threats to the species&#160;are presented by&#160;housing and urban development, road maintenance and widening through the Capertee Valley, recreational activities, livestock farming and ranching, problematic native species and a suppression in fire frequency and intensity. It is inferred that these threats are contributing to a decline in habitat quality. The species has also been reported from the Greater Blue Mountains Area World Heritage Site; during the 2019–20 bushfire season, more than 80% of this world heritage site was burned, and it is suspected that increasing frequency and intensity of bushfires may be contributing to an ongoing decline in availability of suitable habitat here. While the scale and severity of threats to this species are poorly documented, it is estimated that the species may be restricted to between 8–11 locations. Based on this range of locations, the species could qualify for listing as Vulnerable B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii) or Near Threatened B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii). Unsubstantiated observations of the species from within Capertee National Park and the area of Austen quarry have been excluded from this assessment; however, it is plausible that the EOO, AOO and number of locations would still fall within the respective thresholds of the Vulnerable category, even with their inclusion. Additionally, the majority of the population is suspected to occur outside protected areas,&#160;and, as a consequence of the extreme 2019–20 bushfire season, those subpopulations occurring within the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Site&#160;are suspected to be particularly vulnerable to another extreme bushfire season in the short-term. Given this, and adopting a precautionary attitude,&#160;<em>Acacia clandullensis</em>&#160;is assessed as Vulnerable B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii). Survey work is required in order to more precisely elucidate the occupancy of the species within the native distribution, to establish whether it grows more widely, and to enumerate the contemporary population. A thorough evaluation of the impact of threats upon this species is required in order to verify the conservation status and to inform appropriate conservation measures. As most reported collections of this species have been made outside protected areas, site protection is recommended in more disturbed localities.","<em>Acacia clandullensis</em> is an open, pendulous, perennial shrub, growing to between 1 and 2 m in height. It produces pale yellow or yellow inflorescences throughout the year (Conn and Tame 2001, POWO 2019). It occurs in dry sclerophyll forest, frequently in <em>Eucalyptus rossii</em>&#160;woodlands, mostly on stony sandy or loamy clay soils (Conn and Tame 2001, PlantNET 2020). Most collections have been made within the Eastern Australian temperate forests ecoregion, as delineated by Olson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2001); however, disjunct subpopulations near Yerranderie occur in the Southeast Australia temperate forests ecoregion.","Across the Capertee Valley Important Bird and Biodiversity Area, which overlaps with the majority of occurrence records for this species, the major threats to biodiversity have been identified as livestock farming and ranching, problematic native species and a suppression in fire frequency and intensity. The threat of problematic native species is estimated to affect most of this area, while livestock farming and changes in fire regimes affect smaller areas&#160;(BirdLife International 2020). As such, these threats are viewed as relevant to this species; however, the species-specific impact of disturbance by problematic species is not known. The trend of suppressed fire frequency and intensity in the Capertee valley is at odds with the overall trend across Australia and New South Wales. Between 2007 and 2013, weekly bush-fire frequencies increased by 40% across Australia (Dutta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). This trend is partially attributable to anthropogenic climate change, with the extreme bushfire season of 2019–20 between fourfold and ninefold more likely than it would have been in 1900 (Van Oldenborgh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). Many species of <em>Acacia </em>require fire to rejuvenate populations and to break dormancy in seeds (Bell and Elliott 2013)&#160;but even fire-requiring obligate seeders can be eliminated from a site if fires are too frequent and severe (Auld 1987). Where the species occurs within the extensive Greater Blue Mountains Area World Heritage Site, it is suspected that increased fire intensity and frequency represents the greatest threat to the species. At least 80% of the World Heritage Site was reported to have burned during the 2019–20 bushfire season (Cox and Evershed 2020). A number of records have been documented from disturbed roadside localities (<em>Johnstone and Whitton #1303, Salasoo #3645</em>), and it is suspected that road widening and maintenance presents a threat to these plants. Multiple records have also been documented in close proximity to the settlement of Clandulla (<em>Tame #3995, Coveny #9565</em>); clearing for housing and urban development is believed to represent the most plausible threat to the species here, although loss of tree cover in this area over the last 20 years is modest (GFW 2020). Walking is a popular activity in the Glen Davis area (Bushwalking NSW 2020), and it is suspected that accidental trampling and rubbish disposal may present a threat to plants growing here. It should be noted that the majority of the population is believed to occur outside protected area boundaries, which is likely to heighten the susceptibility of the species to threatening processes. A thorough evaluation of the impact of threats upon this species is required and, in particular, identifying the severity of the impact posed by the potentially large-scale threat of invasive and problematic native species.","Descriptions of abundance have varied from scattered at some collection localities (<em>Coveny #9565</em>), to locally frequent at others (<em>Johnstone and Whitton #1303</em>).

Additional plausible threats to the species include the impact of dieback, increasing salinity, weed invasion and fire regimes; however, further research into the life history of this species is necessary to evaluate the risk posed by these threats.

The species has only been recorded from the&#160;Southwest Australia savanna and Swan Coastal Plain Scrub and Woodlands ecoregions, as delineated by Olson <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2001).

Additional plausible threats include the impact of dieback, increasing salinity, weed invasion and fire regimes (Desmond and Chant 2001, Patrick and Brown 2001); however, further research into the life history of this species is necessary to evaluate the risk posed by these threats. Road construction and maintenance along the Badgingarra highway is suspected to impact one subpopulation, and mining operations in the Eneabba area may also pose potential threat to the species (Patrick and Brown 2001, Main Roads Western Australia 2017). The severity of threats is suspected to be exacerbated by the reported small subpopulation sizes and the fact that no subpopulations are known to fall within protected area boundaries (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2020). However, despite the prevalence of agriculture across the native range (Joint Research Centre of the European Commission 2020) and historic conversion of natural habitat to agricultural land (Monks <em>et al.</em> 2019), little land use change is observable over the last 25 years (ESA Climate Change Initiative - Land Cover Project 2018) and contemporary collections have been made at historical localities for the species.

The species has historically been described as common at this locality (<em>Cumming #3351</em>), as compared to occasional near Eneabba (<em>Hislop #3276</em>), and it has never been documented as highly abundant. Taking this documented subpopulation size of 50 plants and extrapolating by the suspected number of subpopulations gives a potential population size of between 300–400 plants. It should be noted, though, that this estimate is considered too speculative to be utilised for the purpose of assessment against Criteria C or D. In support of a restricted population size, no novel subpopulations have been recently identified despite considerable, albeit non-targeted, botanical survey work across the native range (Patrick and Brown 2001). Additionally, suitable habitat is limited as agriculture represents the predominant land use across the Lesueur Sandplain and Dandaragan Plateau (Desmond 2001, Desmond and Chant 2001), thus it seems appropriate to speculate that the species is rare.

As such, it is suspected that a major threat is posed by alteration of roadside maintenance regimes. Further study would be necessary to identify an appropriate frequency of disturbance. Suitable habitat is documented to be affected by broad scale vegetation clearing, increasing fragmentation, grazing pressure, exotic weeds, changed fire regimes, salinity and changed hydrology (Beecham and Danks 2001, Beecham 2001).<em>&#160;</em>Research into the scale and severity of existing and unidentified threats is strongly recommended.","<p><em>Acacia tetraneura&#160;</em>is considered a rare species (Maslin and Chapman 2001).

In 2010, it was estimated that the population comprised 2,283 plants across 19–22 subpopulations. A subpopulation growing southeast of Moora has not been identified in recent surveys, and subpopulations growing on the outskirts of Wongan Hills have been cleared or lost. Additionally, a number of documented subpopulations are represented by fewer than 10 plants and are therefore highly susceptible to extirpation. The number of subpopulations and the quality of habitat are therefore observed to be experiencing ongoing decline, and it is inferred that this is reflected in an ongoing decline in the area of occupancy for the species. However, the overall&#160;population trend is not clear as some subpopulations have experienced population growth over time, while others have experienced decline. The major threats affecting specific subpopulations are urban development, road and rail maintenance, weed invasion and firebreak maintenance. However, the road and rail threats are viewed as mutually exclusive, and the species occurs at a number of roadside localities across both shires; as such, the species is estimated to occur at between 9–12 locations.

This lies within the Southwestern Australia Forests and Scrub priority ecoregion for global conservation (Olson and Dinerstein 2002).","The main threats to the species are road, firebreak and rail maintenance, clearing, weed invasion, recreational activities, rubbish dumping, inappropriate fire regimes, galling, poor recruitment, competition, grazing and farming activities. Subpopulations in the vicinity of Wongan Hills town are surrounded by housing and are threatened by further development, with the habitat of two subpopulations already cleared to construct dwellings&#160;(Department of Environment and Conservation 2010). Recreational activities and rubbish dumping are also threats to subpopulations growing in the vicinity of Wongan Hills settlement. Where the species occurs in road and rail reserves, threats presented by maintenance include accidental damage incurred during grading, weeding, drainage works, sand or gravel extraction and mowing (Patrick and Brown 2001). It has been noted that such disturbance may promote germination (Department of the Environment 2020), thus alteration of the frequency or intensity of roadside maintenance regimes is inferred to represent a threat to the species, rather than maintenance itself. Further study would be necessary to identify an appropriate frequency of disturbance. Additionally, several of these maintenance procedures encourage weed invasion, and one subpopulation is affected by competition from a local native <em>Cuscuta</em>&#160;species (Department of Environment and Conservation 2010). Road and rail reserves are often adjoined by agricultural land; in these areas, further threats are posed through weed invasion, periodic grazing, fertiliser drift and periodic burning (Patrick and Brown 2001). Galling of the flower heads of&#160;<em>Acacia vassalii&#160;</em>by the larvae of a wasp in the Pteromalidae family has been observed in one subpopulation; however, further research is required to determine the effect this has on viability. Grazing by rabbits has also been documented as a threat to subpopulations growing near Piawaning and Watheroo. Additionally, as the species is suspected to germinate following fire, inappropriate fire regimes may affect population viability and, at present, poor recruitment is apparent across most subpopulations (Department of Environment and Conservation 2010). The small numbers of individuals in many subpopulations, together with the limited representation of the species in protected areas, are suspected to heighten the susceptibility of specific subpopulations to extinction through stochastic events (Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2008). The threats to this species have been well profiled; however, ongoing monitoring of habitat trends is necessary, and an evaluation of threats affecting the more recently discovered subpopulations is also required.","In 2010, it was estimated that 2,033 mature plants existed, distributed across 17 subpopulations (Department of Environment and Conservation 2010). Five additional subpopulations comprising about 250 plants have been described since this estimate was made, and it is suspected that these plants were also extant at this time. As such, a revised estimate of 2,283 mature plants in 2010 is proposed. The population trend is not clear as some subpopulations have experienced population growth over time, while others have experienced decline (Department of Environment and Conservation 2010). Additionally, the impact of recovery actions implemented between 2011 and 2015 on the population trend has not yet been evaluated. However, an ongoing decline in the number of subpopulations has been observed; a subpopulation growing southeast of Moora has not been identified in recent surveys (Patrick and Brown 2001), and subpopulations growing on the outskirts of Wongan Hills have been cleared or lost (Department of Environment and Conservation 2010). Additionally, a number of documented subpopulations are represented by fewer than 10 plants and are therefore highly susceptible to extirpation, especially as recruitment is poor in the absence of germination triggers (Department of Environment and Conservation 2010).",Unknown,"Vassal's Wattle is endemic to west-southwest Western Australia (POWO 2019). It is restricted to the area of Wongan Hills and its surrounds, to the east and southeast of Moora, and northeast of Watheroo (Department of Environment and Conservation 2010). An elevational range for the species has not been described, but the altitudes of collection localities range from approximately 260 to 380 m asl.","In spite of detailed profiles about this species, there are no documented uses.

Before the introduction of a recovery plan in 2011, many conservation measures had already been implemented to help protect this species: Declared Rare Flora markers were installed at the localities of many subpopulations; information sheets were distributed to community members; bollards were erected to protect a subpopulation in Wongan Hills from roadworks; monitoring of subpopulations and surveys to identify novel subpopulations were undertaken, and <em>ex situ</em>&#160;germplasm storage and propagation was carried out.&#160;The 2011 recovery plan outlined additional and supplementary measures. These included coordination of recovery actions, installation of additional Declared Rare Flora markers, weed and grazing control, purchase of insecure land tenure, regeneration trials, construction of bollards and fencing, removal of rubbish, research into the biology and ecology of the species, development of a translocation proposal and fire management strategy, continued monitoring and survey work, collection of additional propagation material, mapping of critical habitat, promotion of awareness and community engagement and liaison (Department of Environment and Conservation 2010).<br/><br/>Germplasm accessions of wild origin are held at the Millennium Seed Bank Project in the UK, the Threatened Flora Seed Centre in Western Australia, and the Western Australian Seed Technology Centre (Millennium Seed Bank Partnership Data Warehouse 2020).

The species occupies a restricted range from the Wongan Hills area to Hindmarsh, with an estimated extent of occurrence of 146–956 km<sup>2</sup>, and an estimated area of occupancy of 20–24 km<sup>2</sup>. There is limited numerical population information available for the species, and the current population trend is unknown. Few collections have been made and qualitative descriptions of abundance indicate small subpopulations. The species is estimated to be restricted to 4–5 locations, with road maintenance and recreational activities inferred to be contributing to ongoing decline in habitat quality at specific sites. Additional plausible threats to the species include fertiliser drift, grazing, plant pathogens, rising water tables and inappropriate fire regimes, but further research into the life history and ecology of this species is necessary to evaluate the risk posed by these threats. Declines in habitat quality are suspected to be modest. However, most collections are believed to have been made outside protected area boundaries, the species is not known to benefit from specific conservation measures, and documented subpopulations are suspected to be small, therefore the susceptibility of specific subpopulations to extinction through threatening processes and stochastic events is heightened.&#160;Adopting a precautionary outlook is thus considered advisable.&#160;<em>Gompholobium wonganense</em>&#160;is assessed as Endangered. As the Wongan Hills flora has been the subject of botanical survey, and natural habitat is fragmented, rarity of this species is likely to be genuine, and the total population may be small or very small. It is very possible that the species should qualify for threatened categories under Criterion D1, lending further credibility to its proposed threatened status. However, it is considered more appropriate to exclude this criterion for assessment purposes until it is further validated through population research and wider survey work to more precisely elucidate the contemporary distribution pattern and population status, and to identify subpopulation sizes and trends. A thorough evaluation of the scale and severity of threats to the species is also required.","<em>Gompholobium wonganense</em>&#160;is an erect or decumbent shrub, growing to between 0.15 and 1.2 m in height (Chappill <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). It produces yellow flowers from September to November (Western Australian Herbarium 1998). The species occurs in shrubland in hilly areas on sand over laterite (Western Australian Herbarium 1998, Chappill <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). Species in the genus are fire responsive and generally germinate in large numbers following disturbance (Cochrane 2007).&#160;It has only been recorded from the Southwest Australia savanna ecoregion, as delineated by Olson <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2001).","As early as the 1920s, concern was expressed around the diminishing flora of the Wongan Hills area, and large areas were cleared for agriculture during the 20<sup>th</sup> Century (Coates 1988, Stack <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Monks <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019); however,&#160;it is likely that this threat has largely ceased. Where the species occurs in proximity to the Waddington-Wongan Hills road, threats presented by maintenance of the road may include accidental damage incurred during grading, weeding, drainage works, sand or gravel extraction and mowing (Patrick and Brown 2001, Stack <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Several of these maintenance procedures also encourage weed invasion (Stack <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). This site is also adjoined by arable agriculture; fertiliser drift may represent an additional threat (Patrick and Brown 2001). Both Mt. Matilda and Monks Well Gully are close to areas of recreational use, the former forms part of a popular walking trail and the latter leads to a picnic site (Coates 1988, Stack <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Parks and Wildlife Service 2017); it is suspected that trampling, and possibly rubbish disposal, could disturb the species. Part of the bushland area on the Mt. Rupert Estate north of Mt. Matilda Nature Reserve, near Monks Well Gully, is badly degraded due to grazing by stock (Coates 1988), and it is not clear that appropriate fencing has been erected to mitigate this threat.&#160;In common with other fragments of native vegetation in the Wheatbelt, much of the vegetation in the Wongan Hills has not been burnt in the last 60 years, and the impact of this on composition and structure of plant communities is not clear (Stack <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Monks <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). As <em>Gompholobium </em>species are fire responsive (Cochrane 2007), it is suspected that inappropriate fire regimes would represent a threat to the species. Plant pathogens, particularly <em>Phytophthora</em>&#160;species, and rising saline water table have also been identified as threats to flora in the region (Stack <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).&#160;However, a better understanding of ecological requirements is necessary to identify the impact of these threats upon <em>Gompholobium wonganense</em>. Most collections are believed to have been made outside protected area boundaries, the species is not known to benefit from specific conservation measures, and documented subpopulations are suspected to be small, thus the susceptibility of specific subpopulations to extinction through stochastic events is heightened. It should be noted that little land use change is observable over the last 25 years (ESA Climate Change Initiative - Land Cover Project 2018); as such, it is suspected that the impacts of threats are highly localised. Certainly though, an evaluation of the scale and severity of threats affecting specific subpopulations is urgently required.","One subpopulation has been observed to number just five individuals (<em>Crisp and Cook #MDC 10050</em>), but no further numerical population information is available for this species. Most qualitative descriptions of abundance indicate that the species is rare or sparse at collection sites (<em>Crisp and Cook #MDC 10050, Smith #980, #1629</em>). As the Wongan Hills flora has been the subject of botanical survey, and natural habitat is fragmented (Coates 1988, Stack <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006), it is inferred that this rarity is genuine, and not concomitant with collection effort. Given this, it is suspected that the total population size may be small or very small, however, this cannot be concluded with certainty. The current population trend is not known.

A management programme for Declared Rare and Poorly Known Flora in the Shire of Wongan-Ballidu was published in 2006, and the species may benefit from conservation measures introduced as part of this plan (Stack <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). However, as the species was only formally described in 2008 (Chappill <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008), it was not included on the list of Declared Rare and Poorly Known Flora, and these conservation measures are therefore not specific to this species.

The estimated extent of occurrence lies between 210–640 km<sup>2</sup>, with some uncertainty around the validity of outlying records, and the estimated area of occupancy is not thought to greatly exceed 72 km<sup>2</sup>. The species is locally common along a 15–20 km stretch of Litchfield Park Road, and it is speculated that many thousands of plants occur here; however, the overall population size and trend is not known. The entire range of the species lies in a region that is undergoing clearing for rural residential development, horticulture and cattle grazing, while large feral herbivores, fire, and invasive grasses have been identified as major threats to biodiversity across the native range. Additionally, at one site, proposed mineral extraction represents a significant localised threat to the species. It should also be noted that the species has only been recorded outside protected areas, which heightens its susceptibility to threatening processes.&#160;Although the ecoregion is considered to be fairly stable, and&#160;land use change over the last 20 years has been minimal, it is inferred that these threats are contributing to modest, ongoing decline in area and quality of habitat.&#160;While the broad-scale nature of identified threats, the abundant population along Litchfield Park Road, and some uncertainty in the collection record, make it challenging to assign a precise number of locations to the species, it is estimated that it is restricted to between 5–9. Accordingly, the species could qualify for either Endangered B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii) or Vulnerable B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii). As many thousands of plants are suspected to be present along Litchfield Park Road, ongoing decline is likely to be modest, and the plausible range of locations predominantly lies within the Vulnerable category, this assessment is considered more appropriate.&#160;Although its regional conservation status was previously altered to Data Deficient owing to taxonomic issues, possible intergrades with <em>I. saxicola</em>&#160;at specific sites are not considered likely to impact upon the conservation status assigned. Research and wider survey work are necessary to more precisely elucidate the present day distribution and population size, and to identify subpopulation sizes and trends. An evaluation of the scale and severity of threats to the species is also required. As the species is not known to benefit from the&#160;<em>in-situ</em>&#160;conservation measures implemented within protected areas, establishing site protection is strongly recommended as a conservation action for this species.","<em>Indigofera schultziana</em>&#160;is an erect, multi-stemmed, perennial subshrub, growing to between 30–60 cm in height. It produces pink to purple-flowered inflorescences between August and January (Wilson and Rowe 2004, Holmes <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). The species is closely related to <em>I. saxicola</em>&#160;and, at some sites, intergrades between these two species have been identified (P. Wilson pers. comm. 2020). The ecology of the species is poorly defined; however, it has been recorded in open woodland and on hills or rocky slopes (Holmes <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). The species has only been recorded from the Arnhem Land tropical savanna ecoregion, as delineated by Olson <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2001).","Across the Arnhem land tropical savanna ecoregion, threats to biodiversity are generally considered to be widespread, rather than localised and acute (Woinarksi 2001). The entire range of the species lies in a region that is undergoing clearing for rural residential development, horticulture, and cattle grazing (Holmes <em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). Notably, in the vicinity of Darwin, broad-scale clearing for horticultural production has been undertaken (Woinarski <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001). As the species is most abundant along one of the few major roads in the region, it is suspected that impact from future development will be likely. The species occurs within the Savanna Grazing Land Zone of the Northern Territory, as defined by Fisher <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2004), where large feral herbivores, fire, and invasive grasses have been identified as major threats to biodiversity (Baker <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Price <em>et al.</em> 2008). Feral water buffalo (<em>Bubalus bubalis</em>), cattle (<em>Bos taurus</em> and <em>B. indicus</em>), and pigs (<em>Sus scrofa</em>) are widely distributed across the region and contribute to significant habitat degradation. Over large areas, fire regimes have changed markedly over the last century, with increased incidence of destructive, late dry season fires adversely impacting fire-sensitive species within the landscape (Woinarski 2001). Between 2007 and 2013, weekly bush-fire frequencies increased by 40% across Australia (Dutta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;The invasive species, mission grass (<em>Pennisetum polystachion</em>) and gamba grass (<em>Andropogon gayanus</em>) are particularly prevalent in the eucalypt open forests, increasing competition with indigenous species and contributing to an increased frequency of destructive fires (Woinarksi 2001). The species also has been recorded at a proposed mineral extraction area for the former Rum Jungle mine site (Eco Logical Australia 2014), with potential future clearance representing a major localised threat.&#160;The susceptibility of the species to threatening processes is heightened because it does not occur within protected areas (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2020).&#160;However, it should be noted that land use change across the native range over the last 20 years has been minimal (Joint Research Centre of the European Commission 2020), and the ecoregion is considered to be fairly stable (Woinarksi 2001). While threats to biodiversity across the region have been thoroughly studied, the severity of specific threats to this species is not clear. A more thorough assessment of the scale and severity of threats is therefore required. It is also essential that habitat trends are effectively monitored to identify any loss of suitable habitat, and to inform or prevent future development.","The species is locally abundant along Litchfield Park Road; it has been estimated that many thousands of plants are present in this area (Holmes <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).

The species is only known from a gorge near Bloomfield Springs in the southern section of Kakadu National Park. The extent of occurrence and area of occupancy for the species are estimated to lie between 12 and 20 km<sup>2</sup>.&#160;The population is suspected to be small, and the species may be represented by fewer than 1,000 mature individuals; however, the total population size and current population trend are uncertain. The species is a fire-sensitive, obligate seeder, taking more than two years to reach reproductive age. Recurring fires at short intervals have been observed to cause localised loss of longer-maturing obligate seeder taxa, and given its restricted distribution, the whole population would be susceptible to a higher frequency fire regime. The species is restricted to a single location. It is not clear whether the species has been affected by a higher frequency fire regime as yet; however, between 2007 and 2013, weekly bush-fire frequencies increased by 40% across Australia, and an extreme bushfire season was observed across Australia in 2019–20. Given this, an increase in fire intensity is considered a plausible future threat that could lead to the species becoming Critically Endangered or Extinct in the Wild in a very short time. <em>Jacksonia divisa</em>&#160;is therefore assessed as Vulnerable. Further research into the contemporary distribution and population status of the species is necessary, alongside an evaluation of threats. It is essential that an appropriate fire regime is implemented, characterised by a relatively low frequency of fire with a fire-free interval of three to five years. The life history and fire response characteristics of the species need to be investigated to optimise the development of this regime.","<em>Jacksonia divisa</em>&#160;is an erect, densely branching shrub, growing up to 3 m in height. It produces yellow flowers between April and June (Chappill <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Cowie and Westaway 2012). The divided apex of the phylloclades is unique in the genus (Northern Territory Government 2013). The species occurs in shrubland on sandy kaolinite clay on ledges around the escarpment of the Marrawal Plateau (Cowie and Westaway 2012). It is a fire-sensitive, obligate seeder, found only in longer-unburnt and fire protected pockets amongst sandstone boulders and outcrops (Winderlich and Woinarski 2014). The species appears to undergo large fluctuations in abundance following wildfires, after which plants regenerate from seed; it is suspected that it takes more than two years for individuals to reach reproductive age in the wild (Northern Territory Government 2013). The species has only been documented from the Arnhem Land tropical savanna ecoregion, as delineated by Olson <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2001). This lies within the Northern Australia and Trans-Fly savannas priority ecoregion for global conservation (Olson and Dinerstein 2002).

Recurring fires at short intervals have been observed to cause localised loss of longer-maturing obligate seeder taxa at monitoring plots within Kakadu and Nitmiluk National Park (Russell-Smith 2006, Winderlich and Woinarski 2014). Between 2007 and 2013, weekly bush-fire frequencies increased by 40% across Australia (Dutta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). This trend is partially attributable to anthropogenic climate change, with the extreme bushfire season of 2019–20 between fourfold and ninefold more likely than it would have been in 1900 (Van Oldenborgh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021).&#160;It is not clear that the species has been affected by a higher frequency fire regime as yet; however, the species would be vulnerable to this change in trend and, as such, an increased fire frequency represents a highly plausible future threat.

Recommended conservation actions for this species include an assessment of abundance, distribution and threats, the development of targeted fire management to reduce fire severity and/or frequency, and to establish and implement a specific monitoring scheme (Winderlich and Woinarski 2014). An appropriate fire regime for this species is likely to be characterised by a relatively low frequency of fire with a fire-free interval of three to five years (Cowie and Westaway 2012).

It occupies a restricted range from Collie to Dwellingup and Woodanilling, with an estimated extent of occurrence of 3,110 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and an area of occupancy of 24 km<sup>2</sup>. Following the identification of a novel subpopulation of 275 plants in 2017, the total population is estimated at 400–675 individuals; however, up-to-date numerical population information is required, and the population trend remains unknown. It is suspected that the number of mature individuals fluctuates in response to disturbance events. Ongoing threats to the species are presented by road and firebreak maintenance, gravel extraction, powerline and water pipe maintenance, invasion by weeds, and grazing. Where the species occurs in state forests, forestry operations pose a plausible threat, and inappropriate fire regimes are suspected to represent a plausible threat across the whole range. Additionally, the major part of the population is believed to occur outside protected area boundaries, which is suspected to heighten the susceptibility of the species to these threatening processes. Although conservation advice has been published for this species in Western Australia, the extent to which the proposed conservation measures have been implemented is not clear.&#160;As such, it is inferred that these threatening processes are continuing to contribute to an ongoing decline in quality of habitat. While the scale and severity of threats to this species require more thorough evaluation, it is estimated that the species is restricted to five locations. <em>Jacksonia velveta</em>&#160;is therefore assessed as Endangered. Survey work is necessary to more precisely elucidate the occupancy of the species within its native distribution, to establish whether it grows more widely, and to enumerate the contemporary population. As most reported collections of this species have been made outside protected areas, site protection is recommended in more disturbed localities. If they are not already in place, it is recommended that conservation measures proposed as part of published conservation advice for the species are implemented.","Collie Jacksonia is an erect, densely branching shrub, growing to between 0.5 and 2 m in height, and up to 1 m wide (Chappill <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2008). The species is named for the velvety hairs on the calyx. It differs from close relatives in having strongly angular buds with a velvety indumentum and has the largest flowers of the group. The species produces yellow-orange flowers from November to December (Western Australian Herbarium 1998, Chappill <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). It occurs in low woodland areas on slight hillslopes and ridges, growing in brown to red gravelly loam over laterite (Western Australian Herbarium 1998, Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2008). The species is believed to be a disturbance opportunist, germinating in response to fire (<em>Mallié et al. #MM 110,&#160;</em>Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2008); however, the time taken to reach maturity is unknown and it is suspected that if fire were to occur too frequently, the soil seed bank could be depleted (Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2008).&#160;It has only been recorded from the Southwest Australia woodlands ecoregion, as delineated by Olson <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2001).","Major threats to the species have previously been identified as road and firebreak maintenance, gravel extraction, powerline and water pipe maintenance, weeds, and grazing (Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2008). Where the species occurs in state forests, forestry operations pose a plausible threat (Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2008). The imminent decommissioning of parts of Muja power station (Government of Western Australia 2019) is suspected to cause short-term disturbance to subpopulations growing in the vicinity. At roadside localities in road reserves, road maintenance activities, including grading of roads and drains, chemical spraying and mowing of roadside vegetation, threaten the species. At one roadside locality, invasive Veldt grass (<em>Ehrharta</em> sp.) has been identified, and therefore invasion by weeds is also considered to represent an ongoing threat (Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2008). Grazing by kangaroos and sheep has been identified as a threat to plants growing on private property and in road reserves (Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2008). Inappropriate fire regimes are suspected to represent a plausible threat to the species across its native range.&#160;Although the species is believed to be a disturbance opportunist, germinating in response to fire, the time taken to reach maturity is unknown and it is suspected that if fire were to occur too frequently, the soil seed bank could be depleted, resulting in localised extinction (Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2008). Between 2007 and 2013, weekly bush-fire frequencies increased by 40% across Australia (Dutta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). This trend is partially attributable to anthropogenic climate change, with the extreme bushfire season of 2019–20 between fourfold and ninefold more likely than it would have been in 1900 (Van Oldenborgh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021).&#160;It should be noted that the major part of the population is believed to occur outside protected area boundaries, which is likely to heighten the susceptibility of the species to threatening processes. A contemporary review of threatening processes is required to identify whether any threats have been successfully mitigated in response to previous publication of conservation advice for the species.","In 2008, the number of mature plants was estimated at approximately 400, but the data available were considered insufficient to determine a population trend (Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2008). Since then, a novel subpopulation comprising 275 mature individuals and seedlings has been reported (<em>Mallié et al. #MM 110</em>). As such, a contemporary estimate of between 400–675 plants may be extrapolated; however, up-to-date numerical population information is required, and the population trend remains unknown.

Duval pers. comm. 2021).&#160; Very little information is known about the populations of this species, or its current or future threats, however, like many woody overstorey species of the arid zone, <em>A. symonii</em> is likely to be threatened by the invasion of buffel grass, <em>Cenchrus ciliarus.&#160;</em>Buffel grass establishment in the arid zone is known to increase fire frequency and intensity in the arid zone and is considered a major threat to biodiversity in these regions. Consequently, given the low area of occupancy (AOO &lt;500 km<sup>2</sup>), the sporadic and isolated occurrences of this species, and the potential decline in habitat quality with the encroachment of Buffel grass and the subsequent increase in frequency and intensity of fires, this species is assessed as Vulnerable B2ab(iii).</p>","<em>Acacia symonii </em>is a small tree or tall shrub (3-4m high), with one or more stems arising from ground level (Whibley 1980). This species has been&#160;collected in flower in May, August and December and in pod in September (State Herbarium of South Australia 2007). A report into the conservation status of the southern, arid, bioregions of the Northern Territory, found <em>A. symonii&#160;</em>occurs on hills, scarps and ranges composed of predominantly acid rocks (White <em>et al</em>. 2000). Field surveys in the Everard Ranges found this species to be very localised in pockets of soil on granite hillsides and on the upper slopes of these ranges, and notably, not on lower slopes (D.

Buffel grass is an introduced, perennial pasture grass that can dominate the understorey, form deep root systems, and dense tussocks. Once the foliage dries off, it can form a relatively continuous, flammable ground layer that can carry extensive and intense fires. However, buffel grass, is able to regenerate quickly, and well, after fires, unlike many of the native plant species of this region (CRC for Australian Weed Management 2008). Consequently, the encroachment of buffel grass not only results in hotter and more frequent fires, but it is also able to outcompete the establishment from seed of native species (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2010).&#160;</p><p><em>Acacia symonii </em>is an obligate re-seeder, which means that there can be years between seedling emergence and first flowering, and fire intervals of &lt;5 years are likely to be a significant threat to this species (M.

The species is only known from three small subpopulations growing on a pastoral lease in the vicinity of Mt. Singleton. Its distribution is very restricted with an estimated extent of occurrence and area of occupancy of just 8 km<sup>2</sup>. In 2007, the population numbered just 77 mature individuals, increasing to just over 100 mature individuals in 2009.&#160;A more recent population estimate is not available.&#160;Prior to 2007, grazing by feral goats presented a major threat to this species. However, appropriate conservation measures were introduced to mitigate this threat, and it is suspected that with the abatement of this threat, the population trend may be increasing. Additional plausible threats to the species are presented by track maintenance, inappropriate fire regimes and drought, while the susceptibility of the species to extinction through stochastic events is heightened by the small population size and poor recruitment. At present, though, it is suspected that the species is not directly threatened. However, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, and adopting a precautionary attitude, it is suspected that the population is still small and unlikely to exceed 250 mature individuals.&#160;<em>Acacia unguicula</em>&#160;is therefore assessed as Endangered. It is not clear whether the interim recovery plan remains in place, as it was due to complete in 2014 if the initiatives were deemed successful. Given the restricted distribution and population size of this species, ongoing monitoring of population trends and threats is required. A contemporary population count is also necessary to validate the designated extinction risk category.","Nyingarn Wattle is an erect, open, perennial<em>&#160;</em>shrub to 2 m, or occasionally 3 m tall (Department of Environment and Conservation 2009, POWO 2019). The species produces yellow inflorescences from August to September (Western Australian Herbarium 1998, Cowan 2001). It grows on the upper slopes and summit of Mount Singleton amongst open scrub, on rocky clay or loam (Cowan 2001). Nyingarn Wattle has only been recorded from the Southwest Australia savanna ecoregion, as delineated by Olson <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2001).","Historically, the major threat to this species was grazing by feral goats. In 2001, the majority of mature individuals were observed to be heavily grazed and by 2004 only 43 mature individuals remained. Conservation measures were subsequently implemented to eliminate this threat, including the removal of feral goats from the pastoral lease on which the species occurs, and the installation of a goat-proof fence. Additional plausible threats to the species are presented by track maintenance, inappropriate fire regimes and drought. The susceptibility of the species to extinction through stochastic events is also heightened by the small population size and poor recruitment (Department of Environment and Conservation 2009). The native range is wholly encompassed by a pastoral lease; as such, implementation of recovery actions requires the cooperation of pastoral leaseholders (Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2008). Additionally, a mineral tenement overlaps the distribution (Department of Environment and Conservation 2009). It is also not clear whether an active management plan remains in place, as the interim recovery plan was only proposed to extend until 2014 (Department of the Environment 2020). However, owing to the implementation of appropriate conservation measures it is suspected that the species is not directly threatened at present; monitoring and mitigation of plausible threats will be necessary to ensure that this remains the case.","In 2007, the population was observed to comprise three subpopulations, totaling 77 mature individuals. In 2004, only 43 mature plants were counted, and it is speculated that the subsequent increase was stimulated by the removal of feral goats and installation of a goat-proof fence (Department of Environment and Conservation 2009). A success criterion for the Interim Recovery Plan, operating from June 2008 to May 2013, was a 20% increase in population size (Department of Environment and Conservation 2009),&#160;and collections made in 2009 indicate that the number of mature individuals may have increased to over 100 (Crawford #1999, #2000, #2001, #2023).

Stands therefore tend to be largely even-aged.","<em>Acacia phlebophylla </em>faces threats including the infection by the gall fungus <em>Uromycladium tepperianum</em>. This is a native fungus, and affects many Acacia species. While it does have significant impact, there is no evidence that it has increased in recent times and it is likely that it has always been present in the population. Only older plants appear to be susceptible (and/or the fungus does not reach significant levels until ca 10 years of age) (N. Walsh&#160;pers obs. 2020). Plants are killed by fire which seems to be increasing in frequency on the Mt Buffalo massif (at least four significant fires since 1985). Further increases in fire frequency have the potential to exhaust the soil seed bank and cause at least some local extinctions, but frequencies would need to be in the order of five years or so for this to occur which seems unlikely given the time required for sufficient fuel to develop to carry a substantial fire. There are thought to have been negligible effects on the population due to collection for use as a psychotropic.","Current population estimated to be between 250 and 500 mature plants (based on monitoring results).

The estimated extent of occurrence for the species lies between 24 and 522 km<sup>2</sup>, and the estimated area of occupancy between 24 and 28 km<sup>2</sup>, with uncertainty relating to presence of the species in South Australia. Taxonomic issues have been reported for occurrences in South Australia, and genetic work is ongoing to verify its status here;&#160;the species was previously considered to be endemic to Victoria. It should be noted that the outcome of this investigation is not considered likely to impact the extinction risk category assigned. Estimates of population size made in 2010 indicate that the species was represented by fewer than 2,000 mature individuals at that time; however, the contemporary population size and trend are not known. At all sites surveyed, the major threat to the species is represented by grazing by macropods and/or rabbits. Other documented threats to the species include weed invasion, disturbance owing to trampling, potential development, farming operations, the reactivation of a disused quarry, and the effects of prolonged drought on symbiotic interactions with pollinators and mycorrhizal fungi. Following its listing as Endangered in Victoria,&#160;a National Recovery Plan was prepared for the species and a range of species-specific conservation actions have been implemented, including mitigation against grazing through the erection of fencing and caging; however, many individuals remain susceptible to grazing and other threats, and it is inferred that these processes are collectively contributing to ongoing declines in area and quality of habitat. Most occurrences have been recorded from a very restricted area near Stuart Mill, Victoria. One location is assigned to those individuals susceptible to grazing in the area, and a further location to those protected against grazing activity and disturbance, but susceptible to threats such as weed invasion and drought-related impacts. Based on available information, and the lack of occurrence records, it is considered unlikely that the species occurs at more than two locations in South Australia, giving an estimated range of 2–4 locations for the species. The Red-cross Spider-orchid is therefore assessed as Endangered. Verification of taxonomic identity of specimens collected from South Australia, and elucidation of population status, distribution status, and threatening processes affecting these individuals, represent essential and urgent research requirements. Alongside continued implementation of ongoing recovery actions, survey and mapping of critical habitat remains necessary.","The Red-cross spider-orchid is a perennial, geophytic orchid, growing to between 15 and 25 cm in height (Dixon and Tremblay 2009, Royal Botanic Gardens Board Victoria 2015, WCSP 2020). Flowering occurs between September and October, with the erect, hairy stem typically producing a single red flower to 50 mm across (Jones 1999, Duncan and Coates 2010, Royal Botanic Gardens Board Victoria 2015). It occurs in low open forest or woodland with a heathy understorey, and usually grows on well-drained, grey-brown, sandy loam (The State of Victoria, Department of Sustainability and Environment 2003). Species in the <em>Caladenia</em>&#160;genus are heavily reliant on symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi (Wright <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).","Threats to the Red-cross Spider-orchid in Victoria are well documented. At all sites, the species is impacted by grazing and weed invasion, with disturbance owing to trampling by visiting orchid enthusiasts also apparent; at specific sites, potential development, farming operations, and the reactivation of a disused quarry represent potential future threats (The State of Victoria,&#160;Department of Sustainability and Environment 2003, Duncan and Coates 2010). Of the threats documented, the most significant threat at all sites is grazing by kangaroos or wallabies and/or rabbits; grazing by feral goats and sheep has also been observed at some localities (Duncan and Coates 2010). Conservation measures have been implemented to mitigate against grazing and disturbance through the erection of fencing and caging (The State of Victoria,&#160;Department of Sustainability and Environment 2003, Duncan and Coates 2010); however, many individuals remain susceptible to these threats. The impact of continuing drought on the species, and its pollination and fungal associations is not clear; however, it is suspected that these associations have been adversely affected at some localities, and low flowering rates have been observed at most sites (Duncan and Coates 2010).&#160;<br/><br/>The status of the species in South Australia, and impact of threats, require further investigation; it is suspected that the threat profile would be similar across the whole range. While immediate threats are being mitigated against, it is important that the impact of longer-term threats, such as drought and its impact on maintenance of pollinator activity and fungal associations, are more thoroughly elucidated.","In Victoria, the population was estimated to number 1,450 plants across seven subpopulations in 2010 (Duncan and Coates 2010), with 650 plants in the largest subpopulation. While the exact number of plants in South Australia is not clear, the conservation status assigned to the species in the Lowan Mallee IBRA subregion is indicative of a population of fewer than 250 mature individuals (Department for Environment, Water and Natural Resources, Government of South Australia 2020), and the species has only been recorded from one additional site in Mount Monster Conservation Park (<em>Niejalke #s.n.</em>). Declines in population have been reported in South Australia (Department for Environment, Water and Natural Resources, Government of South Australia 2020), and it is suspected that the ongoing threat to the species presented by grazing is contributing to the loss of individuals in Victoria. However, conservation measures have been implemented to protect some plants from grazing activities (Duncan and Coates 2010), and the species has also been the subject of a reintroduction programme; in 2006, more than 200 plants were translocated to <em>in situ</em>&#160;sites&#160;following <em>in vitro</em>&#160;propagation (Wright <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009), and the second generation of plants have successfully set seed at four different sites (Australian Plants Society Tasmania Inc. Northern Group 2015). Owing to these counteracting influences on plant numbers, the current population trend is unknown. Continued monitoring of the population in Victoria is necessary in order to evaluate the long-term efficacy of conservation measures implemented and to establish a contemporary population trend, while further research into population status and dynamics in South Australia is necessary.",Unknown,"The native range for the Red-cross spider-orchid is Victoria and possibly southeast South Australia (POWO 2019).

As most collections of the species have been recorded from similar habitat to this, it is inferred that the application of fertilisers is contributing to an ongoing decline in the quality of its habitat. Where a large subpopulation has recently been recorded, near Forrestiana, the site is threatened by possible clearance in the next five years. Additional plausible threats include roadside maintenance activities, changes in fire regimes, and the impact of dieback caused by <em>Phytophthora cinnamomi. </em>As only one small subpopulation has been documented from within a protected area, the susceptibility of the species to these threats is suspected to be heightened.&#160;<em>Gastrolobium tenue</em>&#160;is therefore assessed as Endangered.

It is suspected that inappropriate fire regimes and dieback could represent plausible future threats to this species, although its ecological requirements are poorly documented. As the distribution of this species is estimated to be restricted, and the quality of its habitat is inferred to be declining, it is important that threats are thoroughly evaluated to permit effective mitigation, particularly the use of fertilisers in agricultural land adjacent to documented subpopulations.","There is considerable variance in the number of mature plants recorded at specific collection sites.

Furthermore, south-eastern Australia has seen a 12% decline in cold season rainfall (April to October) since the late 1990s, this reduced rainfall is predicted to continue under the changing climate scenario (Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO 2020). Given this is a species of moist forests, it may be inferred that the population of this species will reduce by 30%, or more, over the next 90 years (3 generations) due to declining habitat quality and/or area of occupancy. That said, this species has been grown as an ornamental and has since become naturalised far beyond its native range and is thought to be hybridising with other <em>Acacia </em>spp. in parts of its naturalised distribution. Nevertheless, this species is assessed as Vulnerable, VU A3c, B2ab(i,ii,iii).","<em>Acacia howitii</em> is a graceful shrub, or small tree (3-9 m) that grows in moist forest in southern Victoria (RBGV 2021).","<em>Acacia howittii's&#160;</em>native range includes the damp forests of the Strzelecki Ranges, an Ecological Vegetation Category that is now 12% of its former, pre-1750 range (DSE 2009). Furthermore, the observed warming and reduced rainfall in southeastern Australia since the late 1990s is predicted to continue&#160;as a consequence of human-induced climate change (Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO 2020), which may be inferred to result in further reductions in habitat for this rare, moist forest species.&#160;<em><br/></em>Additionally, alongside the predicted loss of habitat, is the potential loss of genetic integrity from hybridisation with other <em>Acacia </em>species, for example,&#160;<em>A. howittii </em>is thought to hybridise with <em>A. stictophylla, </em><em>A. exudans&#160;</em>(RBGV 2021) and <em>A. leprosa </em>(N.Walsh pers. comm. 2021)<em>,</em>&#160;although to date these hybrid observations have been outside the native range of <em>A. howittii </em>(N.Walsh pers. comm. 2021, RBGV 2021).","This species is rare within its native habitat, however, it has become naturalised far beyond its restricted native habitat (Weeds of Australia 2016).

In the Northern Territory (NT), this species' habitat is in swampy soils within well-developed rainforest, often along the margins of creeks.&#160;&#160;These NT subpopulations are typically small (5-6 individuals) and are facing ongoing threats from invasive species causing habitat disturbance and recruitment losses and through the drying out of the habitat. Little is known about this species, or its threats, in the Cape York region of Queensland, other than that the habitat of this subpopulation is more biodiverse and structurally complex. Nevertheless, this species has a low area of occupancy (AOO of less than 500 km<sup>2</sup>), continuing decline in habitat quality and is likely to suffer from genetic problems due to disjunct and small population sizes. The species has less than five locations. Therefore, this species is assessed as Endangered.</p>","<em>Endiandra limnophila</em> is a rainforest tree that<em>&#160;</em>can grow to 20 m, although is typically shorter. It is only known from very wet, spring-fed, peat-like rainforests in Australia's far north (Kerrigan and Dixon 2011, Kerrigan and Cowie 2006). It has shiny green leaves that are bluish on their underside. Pale green to cream flowers occur in December (Kerrigan and Cowie 2006).<br/><br/>Whilst the distribution, habitat characteristics and threats to this species in the NT are largely understood, the remoteness and climatic environment of the Qld subpopulations means the habitat requirements and threats to these subpopulations are not well understood.&#160; What is known is that the habitat of these two broad regions differ significantly, with Qld subpopulations having a higher degree of structural and species complexity than the NT subpopulations (P.Forster pers. comm. 2021). However, key aspects to this species biology are not known due to the inaccessibility of the habitat during the wet season when this species flowers and fruits (P.Forster pers. comm. 2021).","Threats to this species in the NT are understood, however, the remoteness and inaccessibility of the Queensland subpopulation mean they are poorly understood in this state. In the NT, this species' habitat is in swampy soils within well-developed rainforest, often along the margins of creeks, consequently one of the greatest threats to this species is if the rainforest dries out. This threat can be triggered or exacerbated by unseasonal dry weather; the invasion of weedy plant species (e.g. Mission grass), which increase the fuel load (and the fire hazard); vegetation clearance; and water extraction. The drying out of the rainforest, is itself a trigger for increased fire frequency (Crowley 2008). Another threat to this species is the effect of invasive animal species (such as pigs and buffalo), both of these animals disturb the soil and prevent recruitment of new rainforest plants (Crowley 2008, Liddle <em>et al.</em> 2008).","The population of this species in the Northern Territory was estimated as &lt;1,000 individuals, however, each location typically only had 5 or 6 individuals at it (Kerrigan and Cowie 2006).",Unknown,"<em>Endiandra limnophila&#160;</em>is found in the far north of Cape York Peninsula (Queensland); the Tiwi Islands (Bathurst Island and the western part of Melville Island), and in an isolated population at Channel Point in the Northern Territory.

201146628,201141387,Melaleuca nanophylla,Vulnerable,"B2ab(iii,v)",2021,2021-06-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Melaleuca nanophylla </em>is a rare, arid zone, tea-tree that is endemic to the remote northwest of South Australia and an isolated region of eastern Western Australia. It has a small area of occupancy (AOO of &lt;500 km<sup>2</sup>), and is only known from two remote localities. Major threats to this species are not known, however, low seed set and recruitment have been observed. The two known populations are quite localised and appear restricted to a specific niche, so, whilst it has a large extent of occurrence, it has a very restricted area of occupancy within that range. Consequently, this species is assessed as Vulnerable.","<em>Melaleuca nanophylla </em>is a shrub or small tree (3-5m) that flowers irregularly (State Herbarium of South Australia 2021, Western Australian Herbarium 2021). It has numerous, short branchlets that are densely covered with leaves. Although not deciduous (M. O'Leary pers. comm. 2021), the leaves drop after drying and pressing and eventually only a few leaves remain at the apices, leaving a very slender white stem excavated where the leaves were attached, branches are dark grey, bark is rough, and more or less fissured (Carrick and Chorney 1979).&#160;This species is commonly found on gypseous soils. It is recorded from&#160;the edge of clay pans, gypseous flats, calcareous outcrops, and on sandy clay (Brophy <em>et al.</em> 2013).","<p>This species is found in very remote regions of arid Australia. Whilst little is known is about this species and its threats, it has been noted that the trees appear very old (M. O'Leary&#160;pers. comm. 2021) and their distribution appears to be very localised with very little viable seed set for a <em>Melaleuca</em> and no seedlings (D. Duval pers. comm. 2021). Consequently, low levels of recruitment is a potential threat to this species. Seed production might be restricted to 1 in 10 or 1 in 20 years after favourable rainfall events (D.Duval pers. comm. 2021).&#160;</p><p>Broadly, the current major threats to Australia's arid shrublands and open woodlands include&#160;invasion by exotic pasture grasses (e.g.&#160;<em>Cenchrus ciliaris&#160;</em>L., buffel grass); increasing fire frequency and intensity; and overgrazing by native, domestic and feral herbivores (Nano <em>et al.</em> 2017).

Field experts have noted that it is restricted in distribution in South Australia, where it is only known from Emu and Waldana Well (D.Duval pers. comm. 2021).&#160;The populations are potentially restricted to a specific niche i.e. gypseous mounds on the edges of ephemeral water bodies such as clay pans and springs/wells. It was not present on the edges of Serpentine Lakes (D.Duval pers. comm. 2021).","This species is not known to be used or traded. Related species, however, are harvested for medicinal oils in their leaves and as such the genus was investigated for their chemical components.&#160;<em>Melaleuca nanophylla </em>was found to&#160;contain a b-triketone, flavesone (44%), and a-pinene (40.1%) as the principal components of its leaf oil (Brophy <em>et al.</em> 2013).",Terrestrial,"This species is not subject to any conservation actions.
